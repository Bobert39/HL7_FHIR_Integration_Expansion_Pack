# Conduct Security Assessment Task

## Purpose
Perform comprehensive security analysis of healthcare integration solutions to ensure PHI protection, regulatory compliance, and robust defense against healthcare-specific threats.

## Task Definition
- **ID**: conduct-security-assessment
- **Description**: Execute systematic security evaluation including threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, and compliance validation for healthcare integration systems
- **Assigned Agent**: healthcare-it-security-analyst
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-5 days per integration solution

## Inputs
- Integration architecture documentation and system designs
- Implementation code and configuration files
- FHIR profiles and API specifications
- Network diagrams and infrastructure documentation
- Compliance requirements (HIPAA, HITECH, state regulations)

## Process Steps
1. **Threat Modeling**
   - Identify healthcare-specific threat vectors and attack scenarios
   - Analyze data flow paths and potential entry points
   - Assess risks to PHI confidentiality, integrity, and availability
   - Evaluate authentication and authorization mechanisms

2. **Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Code review for security vulnerabilities and best practices
   - API security testing and input validation analysis
   - Infrastructure security configuration review
   - Third-party dependency security analysis

3. **Compliance Validation**
   - HIPAA Technical Safeguards assessment
   - Administrative and Physical Safeguards review
   - Audit logging and monitoring capability evaluation
   - Data encryption and access control verification

4. **Penetration Testing**
   - Simulated attacks on API endpoints and interfaces
   - Authentication bypass and privilege escalation testing
   - Data leakage and information disclosure analysis
   - Network security and communication channel testing

## Outputs
- Comprehensive security assessment report
- Threat model documentation with risk ratings
- Vulnerability findings with remediation recommendations
- HIPAA compliance gap analysis and action items
- Security testing results and evidence documentation
- Security architecture recommendations and best practices

## Security Focus Areas
- **PHI Protection**: Encryption, access controls, data minimization
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication, identity verification
- **Authorization**: Role-based access, least privilege principles
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging, tamper resistance
- **Network Security**: TLS/SSL, secure communications, network segmentation
- **Incident Response**: Breach detection, response procedures

## Quality Gates
- All critical and high-risk vulnerabilities identified and documented
- HIPAA compliance requirements thoroughly evaluated
- Security recommendations are actionable and prioritized
- Testing demonstrates robust security controls
- Clinical and technical teams understand security implications

## Tools and Standards
- **Security Testing Tools**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, static analysis tools
- **Compliance Frameworks**: HIPAA, NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Industry Standards**: OAuth 2.0, SMART on FHIR security specifications
- **Healthcare Guidelines**: HHS Security Risk Assessment guidance

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive security posture assessment completed
- All security risks identified, assessed, and documented
- Compliance gaps clearly identified with remediation plans
- Security recommendations prioritized by risk and impact
- Integration solution meets healthcare security standards
- Stakeholders confident in security and compliance posture
