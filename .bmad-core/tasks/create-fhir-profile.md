# Create FHIR Profile Task

## Purpose
Create comprehensive FHIR profiles that accurately represent clinical data requirements and ensure interoperability compliance with HL7 FHIR R4 standards.

## Task Definition
- **ID**: create-fhir-profile
- **Description**: Create validated FHIR StructureDefinition profiles based on clinical requirements using Firely .NET SDK and industry best practices
- **Assigned Agent**: fhir-interoperability-specialist
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-4 hours per profile

## Inputs
- Clinical requirements document with detailed data specifications
- Relevant base FHIR R4 resources (Patient, Observation, etc.)
- Existing FHIR profiles for reference and compatibility
- Terminology and value set requirements
- Security and privacy constraints

## Process Steps
1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Review clinical requirements and identify core data elements
   - Map clinical concepts to appropriate FHIR resources
   - Identify constraints, extensions, and cardinality requirements
   - Validate against existing FHIR profiles for compatibility

2. **Profile Creation Phase**
   - Create StructureDefinition using Firely .NET SDK
   - Define element constraints, data types, and cardinality
   - Add necessary extensions for clinical requirements
   - Implement terminology bindings and value sets

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Validate profile structure against FHIR R4 specification
   - Test with sample data instances
   - Verify constraint logic and business rules
   - Ensure compatibility with target systems

4. **Documentation Phase**
   - Generate profile documentation and implementation notes
   - Create usage examples and test instances
   - Document extension definitions and terminology requirements

## Outputs
- FHIR StructureDefinition file (.json format)
- Profile documentation with implementation guidance
- Sample resource instances demonstrating profile usage
- Validation test cases and expected results
- Extension definitions (if custom extensions required)

## Quality Gates
- Profile validates successfully against FHIR R4 specification
- All clinical requirements are accurately represented
- Profile is compatible with target healthcare systems
- Documentation is complete and clear for implementers
- Test instances validate against the profile

## Tools Required
- Firely .NET SDK for profile creation and validation
- FHIR validation tools (Forge, Simplifier.net)
- JSON/XML editors for profile refinement
- Terminology services for value set validation

## Success Criteria
- Profile successfully represents all required clinical data elements
- Validation passes without errors using official FHIR validators
- Clinical team approves profile accuracy and completeness
- Technical team confirms implementation feasibility
- Profile is ready for implementation and testing
