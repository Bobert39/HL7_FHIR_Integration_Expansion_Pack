# Task: Create FHIR Validation Suite

## Purpose
Create an automated test suite for validating FHIR resources using the Firely .NET SDK to ensure continuous data integrity in healthcare integrations.

## Input Requirements
- FHIR profiles and structure definitions created in previous stories
- Sample FHIR resources directory for validation testing
- Validation configuration parameters (profiles to validate against, error thresholds)
- Target CI/CD platform configuration (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.)

## Output Deliverables
- `FhirIntegrationService.ValidationSuite` .NET project with automated validation capabilities
- Validation test suite with comprehensive FHIR resource validation using Firely .NET SDK 5.x
- CI/CD integration scripts for automated validation execution in pipelines
- Validation reporting system with detailed error reporting and pass/fail statistics
- Sample FHIR resources (synthetic, non-PHI) for comprehensive testing scenarios

## Task Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Architecture
1. **Create ValidationSuite Project Structure**
   - Add new `FhirIntegrationService.ValidationSuite` project to existing solution
   - Configure project dependencies: Firely .NET SDK 5.x, xUnit testing framework
   - Set up project structure following .NET 8.0 coding standards

2. **Define Core Validation Components**
   - Design `IFhirResourceValidator` interface for validation abstraction
   - Plan `FhirResourceValidator` implementation using Firely SDK validation methods
   - Define `ValidationReport` class structure for comprehensive error reporting

### Phase 2: Core Validation Implementation
3. **Implement FHIR Resource Validator**
   - Create `FhirResourceValidator` class implementing IFhirResourceValidator
   - Integrate Firely .NET SDK 5.x validation methods for profile-based validation
   - Add support for both JSON and XML FHIR resource formats
   - Implement async validation patterns following coding standards

4. **Add Directory Scanning and Batch Processing**
   - Implement directory scanning functionality for bulk FHIR resource processing
   - Add file format detection and validation orchestration
   - Create batch validation capabilities with progress reporting
   - Ensure performance targets: single resource <500ms, batch (100 resources) <30 seconds

5. **Integrate Profile-Based Validation**
   - Load and validate against project-specific FHIR profiles from previous stories
   - Implement structure definition validation using Firely SDK capabilities
   - Add terminology validation and cardinality constraint checking
   - Include custom validation rules specific to healthcare integration requirements

### Phase 3: Reporting and Output
6. **Create Comprehensive Validation Reporting**
   - Implement `ValidationReport` class with structured error reporting
   - Generate detailed validation results with element paths and failure reasons
   - Create summary reporting with pass/fail statistics and error categorization
   - Add validation timing and performance metrics collection

7. **Generate Multiple Report Formats**
   - Implement HTML report generation for human-readable validation results
   - Create JSON report format for automated processing and CI/CD integration
   - Add console output formatting for immediate feedback
   - Include validation artifacts and evidence collection

### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration
8. **Create MSBuild Integration**
   - Add MSBuild targets for automated validation execution
   - Implement proper exit codes for pipeline success/failure determination
   - Create configuration system for validation thresholds and failure criteria
   - Add build artifact generation for validation reports

9. **GitHub Actions Workflow Integration**
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow for validation on PR/commit
   - Implement validation report artifact storage and retrieval
   - Add notification system for validation failures
   - Configure parallel validation execution for performance

10. **Docker Containerization**
    - Create Dockerfile for validation service deployment
    - Implement container-based validation execution
    - Add volume mounting for FHIR resource directories
    - Configure environment variables for validation parameters

### Phase 5: Testing and Sample Data
11. **Generate Synthetic FHIR Test Data**
    - Use Synthea synthetic patient generator for realistic test data
    - Implement Firely .NET SDK synthetic data generators
    - Create valid and invalid sample resources for comprehensive testing
    - Generate edge case resources for boundary testing scenarios

12. **Create Automated Data Generation Scripts**
    - Implement scripts for continuous synthetic data generation
    - Add performance test datasets (small/medium/large)
    - Create scenario-based test data (patient workflows, clinical scenarios)
    - Ensure all test data is synthetic and non-PHI compliant

## Quality Gates and Validation
- **Performance Requirements**: Meet specified validation timing targets
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure no PHI in logs, synthetic data only
- **FHIR Compliance**: Validate against FHIR R4 specification and project profiles
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests for all validation components
- **CI/CD Integration**: Successful pipeline integration with proper exit codes

## Technical Requirements
- **Language**: C# 12 targeting .NET 8.0 runtime
- **Framework**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x for FHIR validation capabilities
- **Testing**: xUnit framework with FluentAssertions for validation result testing
- **Standards Compliance**: HL7 FHIR R4, coding standards from architecture documentation

## Dependencies
- Completed FHIR integration service from Epic 4 stories
- FHIR profiles and structure definitions from previous development cycles
- Existing project structure and solution file
- CI/CD pipeline configuration and access

## Success Criteria
- Validation suite successfully validates FHIR resources against project profiles
- Comprehensive reporting system provides actionable validation results
- CI/CD integration enables automated validation in development workflows
- Performance targets met for both individual and batch validation scenarios
- Complete test coverage with synthetic FHIR resources for all validation scenarios

## Notes
- Follow NO PHI IN LOGS rule strictly - use only synthetic test data
- Implement async/await patterns throughout for I/O operations
- Use custom exceptions for validation-specific error handling
- Apply Polly resilience patterns for file operations and external calls
- Maintain coding standards: PascalCase classes/methods, camelCase variables, _camelCase private fields
