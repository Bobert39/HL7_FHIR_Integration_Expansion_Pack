# Initial Scoping Task

## Purpose
Guide initial discovery of a target system, gathering publicly available documentation and preparing for technical deep-dive integration analysis.

## Task Definition
- **ID**: initial-scoping
- **Description**: Guide user through discovery of target system's public API documentation, developer contacts, and initial integration requirements
- **Assigned Agent**: healthcare-system-integration-analyst
- **Estimated Duration**: 1-2 hours for initial discovery
- **Elicit**: true

## Inputs
- Target system name (e.g., "OpenEMR", "Epic", "Cerner", "AllScripts")
- Basic information about integration goals (if available)

## Interactive Process Steps

### Step 1: Target System Identification
**User Input Required:**
- What is the name of the target healthcare system you want to integrate with?
- Do you have any existing relationship or contact with this vendor?
- What type of integration are you planning (read data, write data, bidirectional)?

### Step 2: Public Documentation Discovery
**Guided User Actions:**
1. Search for the target system's developer documentation website
2. Locate API documentation and developer resources
3. Find FHIR implementation guides (if available)
4. Identify authentication and authorization documentation
5. Look for developer contact information and support channels

### Step 3: Vendor Contact Information Gathering
**User Input Required:**
- Developer support email or contact form
- Technical sales or partnership contacts
- Developer community forums or resources
- Any existing vendor relationships or contacts

### Step 4: Initial Requirements Assessment
**Interactive Questions:**
1. What specific data do you need to access (patients, appointments, clinical data)?
2. What is your expected data volume and frequency?
3. Do you have specific security or compliance requirements?
4. What is your timeline for this integration?
5. Do you need real-time or batch data access?

## Outputs
- **Partially completed Integration Partner Profile document** containing:
  - Target system name and vendor information
  - Public API documentation URLs
  - Developer contact information
  - Initial integration requirements
  - Key technical questions for vendor follow-up

## Generated Templates
During this task, the following templates will be used:
1. **Integration Partner Profile**: Basic profile structure with initial findings
2. **Vendor Technical Questions**: Structured questions for vendor technical teams
3. **API Documentation Checklist**: Systematic documentation discovery guide

## Success Criteria
- Target system identified and basic vendor information collected
- Public API documentation URLs found and documented
- Developer contact information gathered
- Initial integration requirements documented
- Key technical questions prepared for vendor engagement
- Foundation established for technical research phase

## Next Steps
After completing this task:
1. Contact vendor technical team with prepared questions
2. Proceed to technical-research task for API testing
3. Document any vendor responses or additional information
