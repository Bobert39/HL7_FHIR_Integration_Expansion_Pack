# Technical Research Task

## Purpose
Guide API endpoint testing, authentication validation, and technical documentation using Integration Partner Profile as input.

## Task Definition
- **ID**: technical-research
- **Description**: Guide user in testing target system's authentication endpoints, API functionality, and updating Integration Partner Profile with confirmed technical details
- **Assigned Agent**: healthcare-system-integration-analyst
- **Estimated Duration**: 2-4 hours for initial API testing
- **Elicit**: true

## Inputs
- Integration Partner Profile from initial-scoping task
- Vendor API credentials (if available)
- Access to Postman or similar API testing tool

## Interactive Process Steps

### Step 1: Prerequisites Validation
**User Input Required:**
- Do you have the Integration Partner Profile from the initial scoping phase?
- Have you received API credentials from the vendor?
- Do you have access to Postman, curl, or another API testing tool?
- Is there a sandbox environment available for testing?

### Step 2: Authentication Testing Setup
**Guided User Actions:**
1. Set up testing environment (Postman collection or curl commands)
2. Configure base URL and endpoint information from Integration Partner Profile
3. Set up authentication method based on vendor documentation:
   - OAuth2 flow configuration
   - API key header setup
   - SMART on FHIR authentication
   - Certificate-based authentication

### Step 3: Authentication Flow Testing
**Interactive Testing Workflow:**
1. **Token Acquisition Testing:**
   - Test authentication endpoint with provided credentials
   - Verify token response format and content
   - Document token expiration and refresh mechanisms
   - Record any authentication errors or issues

**User Input Required:**
- What authentication method is being used?
- Were you able to successfully obtain an access token?
- What is the token format (JWT, opaque token, etc.)?
- How long is the token valid?
- Are there any authentication errors or warnings?

### Step 4: API Endpoint Testing
**Guided API Testing:**
1. **Patient Record Query Testing:**
   - Test patient search endpoint (if FHIR-based)
   - Query sample patient record using valid ID
   - Test patient demographics endpoint
   - Verify response format and data structure

2. **Additional Endpoint Testing:**
   - Test other critical endpoints (appointments, observations, etc.)
   - Verify CRUD operations (if applicable)
   - Test error handling with invalid requests
   - Check rate limiting behavior

**User Input Required:**
- What endpoints were successfully tested?
- What data format is returned (JSON, XML, HL7)?
- Are there any unexpected response formats or structures?
- What error messages are returned for invalid requests?
- Did you encounter any rate limiting?

### Step 5: Data Structure Analysis
**Response Analysis:**
1. Analyze patient record structure and format
2. Document available data fields and their formats
3. Identify any custom extensions or non-standard implementations
4. Note any missing expected data elements

**User Input Required:**
- What patient data fields are available?
- Is the response format standard FHIR, HL7 v2.x, or custom?
- Are there any vendor-specific extensions or customizations?
- What clinical data types are accessible?

### Step 6: Performance and Limitations Testing
**Performance Assessment:**
1. Test response times for typical queries
2. Verify pagination handling for large result sets
3. Test concurrent request handling
4. Document any performance issues or limitations

**User Input Required:**
- What are typical response times for API calls?
- How does the API handle large result sets?
- Are there any performance limitations or issues?
- What happens when rate limits are exceeded?

## Outputs
- **Enhanced Integration Partner Profile document** containing:
  - Confirmed API Base URL and working endpoints
  - Validated Authentication Method with working flow
  - List of tested Endpoints and Supported Operations
  - Documented response formats and data structures
  - Performance characteristics and limitations
  - Error handling behavior and codes

## Generated Templates
During this task, the following templates will be used:
1. **Postman Testing Guide**: Step-by-step API testing workflow
2. **API Authentication Checklist**: Authentication flow validation
3. **Endpoint Testing Protocol**: Systematic API endpoint testing
4. **Integration Profile Update**: Enhanced profile structure

## Success Criteria
- Authentication flow successfully tested and documented
- At least one patient record successfully retrieved via API
- API base URL and key endpoints confirmed and documented
- Response format and data structure documented
- Integration Partner Profile updated with confirmed technical details
- Performance characteristics and limitations documented

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- **Invalid credentials**: Verify credentials with vendor
- **Token expiration**: Test token refresh mechanism
- **Scope issues**: Verify required scopes are granted
- **CORS errors**: May need to test from server environment

### API Access Issues
- **Network connectivity**: Verify network access to API endpoints
- **SSL/TLS issues**: Check certificate requirements
- **Rate limiting**: Implement proper request spacing
- **Endpoint availability**: Confirm endpoint URLs are correct

### Data Format Issues
- **Unexpected format**: Document actual vs expected format
- **Missing data**: Note any missing expected fields
- **Custom extensions**: Document vendor-specific implementations
- **Validation errors**: Check data validation requirements

## Next Steps
After completing this task:
1. Share enhanced Integration Partner Profile with stakeholders
2. Proceed to document-quirks task for vendor-specific implementation details
3. Begin detailed integration planning based on confirmed capabilities
4. Plan development phase with validated technical specifications

## Security Considerations
- **Credential Protection**: Never log or expose API credentials
- **Test Data Only**: Use only test data and sandbox environments
- **Secure Storage**: Store credentials securely during testing
- **Access Logging**: Be aware that API testing activities may be logged
