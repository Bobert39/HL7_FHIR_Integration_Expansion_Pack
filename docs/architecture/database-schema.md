# Section 8 of 12: Database Schema

The code generated by this expansion pack is designed to be stateless. The integration services act as a transformation and validation layer, fetching data from a source system (the vendor API), converting it into the FHIR format in memory, and then returning it or passing it to another system.

Therefore, the integration services themselves do not have their own dedicated database schema.

**Data persistence strategy:**

- **Source of Truth:** The vendor EHR/PM system's database remains the authoritative source for all clinical and administrative data. Our integration service reads from this source via its API.
- **FHIR Server (Optional):** In architectures where the transformed FHIR data needs to be stored, it would be persisted in a dedicated FHIR Server (like Firely Server, Azure API for FHIR, or HAPI FHIR). The schema for this is the standard, internationally recognized schema for FHIR R4 resources, which is a core part of the FHIR specification itself. Our agents will generate code that is compliant with this standard schema but will not define the schema itself.
- The C#/.NET models generated by our agents will represent the FHIR resources in memory for the purpose of transformation and validation. This stateless design is a deliberate architectural choice.
