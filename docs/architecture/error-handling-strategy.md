# Section 11 of 12: Error Handling Strategy

## General Approach

- **Error Model:** The generated code will use a custom exception hierarchy. There will be a `BaseIntegrationException` with specific derived exceptions like `VendorApiNotAvailableException`, `FhirValidationException`, and `DataMappingException`. This allows for precise try/catch blocks that can handle different failure modes appropriately.
- **Error Propagation:** All exceptions will be caught at the API controller level and translated into a standardized, user-friendly JSON error response. Raw stack traces must never be exposed to the client.

## Logging Standards

- **Library:** The generated code will use a structured logging library, with Serilog being the recommended default.
- **Format:** Logs must be in JSON format to facilitate automated parsing and analysis by tools like Splunk or the ELK Stack.
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Under no circumstances shall any Protected Health Information (PHI) be written to logs. The logging middleware will be configured to automatically filter out any fields known to contain PHI.
- **Required Context:** Every log entry must include:
  - `CorrelationId`: A unique ID that tracks a single request as it moves through the system.
  - `FhirResourceId`: The ID of the FHIR resource being processed, if applicable.
  - `VendorSystemName`: The name of the external system being called.

## Error Handling Patterns

- **External API Errors:** For calls to external vendor APIs, the generated code will use the Polly library to implement:
  - **Retry Policy:** A transient fault-handling policy that automatically retries failed requests (e.g., due to temporary network issues) with an exponential backoff strategy.
  - **Circuit Breaker:** A policy that will automatically stop sending requests to an external API if it detects that the service is down, preventing cascading failures.
- **Business Logic Errors:**
  - **User-Facing Errors:** Business logic exceptions (e.g., `FhirValidationException`) will be translated into standard HTTP 400 Bad Request or HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity responses with a clear error message.
  - **System Errors:** Unexpected system exceptions will result in a generic HTTP 500 Internal Server Error, and the detailed exception will be logged with a high severity level.
