# Section 10 of 12: Infrastructure and Deployment

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

This expansion pack is a design-time tool, not a runtime service. As such, it does not have its own operational infrastructure. The primary "infrastructure" is the BMad framework itself.

However, the code generated by this pack is architected to be deployed to modern cloud infrastructure. The agents will provide guidance and generate code that is compatible with:

- **Serverless Platforms:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions.
- **Container Platforms:** Docker, with orchestration via Kubernetes or services like AWS Fargate.

The agents' tasks can be extended in the future to generate basic IaC templates (e.g., AWS SAM, Terraform) for these target platforms.

## Deployment Strategy

- **Deploying the Pack:** The expansion pack is "deployed" or "installed" by placing its directory structure (e.g., `hl7-fhir-expansion-pack/`) into the `.bmad-core/expansion-packs/` directory of a user's BMad-enabled project. Versioning will be managed through Git.
- **Deploying the Generated Service:** The agents in this pack will guide the user through the process of setting up a standard CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) for the generated C#/.NET integration service. The pipeline will build, test, and deploy the service to the user's chosen cloud environment.

## Environments

The pack itself has only one environment: the user's local BMad project. The generated integration service will be designed to support standard multi-environment setups (e.g., Development, Staging, Production) through standard .NET configuration practices.
