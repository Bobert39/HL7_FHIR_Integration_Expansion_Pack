# Section 1 of 12: Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the HL7 FHIR Integration Expansion Pack, including its internal structure, components, and the architectural patterns for the code it will generate. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This project will be built using an existing BMad expansion pack as a foundational template. This approach will accelerate development by providing a pre-configured file structure and component organization that aligns with BMad best practices. The specific structure will be detailed in the "Source Tree" section of this document.
