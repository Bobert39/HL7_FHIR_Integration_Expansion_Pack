# Clinical Requirements Summary
*Compiled from Epic 1 and related stories for Implementation Guide*

## Overview

This document summarizes the clinical requirements and use cases identified throughout the HL7 FHIR Integration Expansion Pack project, serving as input for the Implementation Guide clinical context section.

## Clinical Use Cases

### Primary Use Case: FHIR Integration Development Workflow

**Clinical Workflow:**
Healthcare organizations need to integrate disparate systems using HL7 FHIR standards to improve patient care coordination and data interoperability.

**Data Requirements:**
- Patient demographic information (FHIR Patient resource)
- Clinical observations and measurements (FHIR Observation resource)
- Medication information (FHIR Medication, MedicationRequest resources)
- Diagnostic and laboratory results (FHIR DiagnosticReport resource)
- Care provider information (FHIR Practitioner resource)

**Technical Implementation:**
- SMART on FHIR authentication for secure access
- RESTful API endpoints following FHIR R4 specification
- Data validation against custom FHIR profiles
- Real-time data synchronization between systems

### Secondary Use Case: Clinical Decision Support Integration

**Clinical Workflow:**
Clinical informaticists need to configure decision support systems that can consume FHIR data to provide evidence-based recommendations at the point of care.

**Data Requirements:**
- Real-time access to patient clinical data
- Integration with clinical guidelines and protocols
- Audit trail for decision support recommendations
- Performance metrics for system optimization
