## Technical Research Plan

### Phase 1: Sandbox Environment Testing (Week 1)
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Access OpenEMR demo environment at https://demo.openemr.io/
   - Set up development tools and API testing environment
   - Configure authentication credentials for testing

2. **Basic API Validation**
   - Test authentication flow and token acquisition
   - Verify basic connectivity to FHIR endpoints
   - Validate API response formats and error handling

### Phase 2: FHIR Endpoint Analysis (Week 2)
1. **Core Resource Testing**
   - Patient resource: demographics, identifiers, contact information
   - Observation resource: lab results, vital signs, clinical measurements
   - Encounter resource: visit information, provider details
   - Medication resources: prescriptions, administration records

2. **Data Model Analysis**
   - Document actual data structures returned by each endpoint
   - Identify any custom fields or non-standard implementations
   - Map available data elements to target integration requirements

### Phase 3: Integration Feasibility Assessment (Week 3)
1. **Performance Analysis**
   - Measure API response times under various load conditions
   - Test rate limiting behavior and recovery mechanisms
   - Assess data volume handling capabilities

2. **Security Validation**
   - Verify encryption and secure communication protocols
   - Test authentication security and token management
   - Review audit logging and compliance features

## Risk Assessment
