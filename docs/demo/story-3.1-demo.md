```

### Step 2: Initiate Initial System Scoping

```bash
# User runs the initial scoping task
*initial-scoping
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
I'll guide you through the initial discovery of your target healthcare system.

This process will help us gather all publicly available documentation and prepare for technical deep-dive analysis.

Let's start with some basic information:

**Step 1: Target System Identification**

1. What is the name of the target healthcare system you want to integrate with?
   (Examples: OpenEMR, Epic, Cerner, AllScripts, Athenahealth, NextGen)

Please provide the system name:
```

### Step 3: User Provides Target System

```bash
# User responds
OpenEMR
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Excellent choice! OpenEMR is a popular open-source electronic health record system.

2. Do you have any existing relationship or contact with this vendor?
   a) Yes, we have technical contacts
   b) Yes, we have business relationships
   c) No existing relationship
   d) We are current OpenEMR users

Your choice:
```

### Step 4: Continue Information Gathering

```bash
# User responds
c
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
3. What type of integration are you planning?
   a) Read-only (pulling data from OpenEMR)
   b) Write-only (sending data to OpenEMR)
   c) Bidirectional (both read and write)
   d) Real-time notifications/webhooks

Your choice:
```

### Step 5: Complete Initial Assessment

The agent continues gathering information about:
- Integration goals and use cases
- Expected data volume and frequency
- Security and compliance requirements
- Project timeline
- Specific data types needed (patients, appointments, clinical data)

### Step 6: Guided Documentation Discovery

**Agent provides research guidance:**
```
Now I'll guide you through discovering OpenEMR's public documentation.

**Step 2: Public Documentation Discovery**

Let's systematically research OpenEMR's technical resources:

1. **Developer Portal Search**
   - Search for: "OpenEMR developer documentation"
   - Look for: "OpenEMR API documentation"
   - Check: "OpenEMR FHIR implementation"

Please search and tell me what you find for the main developer portal URL:
```

**User Research Process:**
The agent guides the user through finding:
- Main developer documentation website
- API documentation and endpoints
- FHIR implementation guides
- Authentication and authorization docs
- Developer community resources
- Sandbox/testing environments

### Step 7: Vendor Contact Information

**Agent continues:**
```
**Step 3: Vendor Contact Information Gathering**

Now let's identify how to reach OpenEMR's technical team:

1. Look for developer support channels:
   - Technical support email
   - Developer community forums
   - GitHub repositories and issue tracking
   - Professional services contacts

2. Check for partnership opportunities:
   - Technical partnership programs
   - Integration certification processes
   - Developer community membership

What developer contact information did you find?
```

### Step 8: Generated Integration Partner Profile

**Agent Output:**
```
Excellent work! I've gathered comprehensive information about OpenEMR.

Now I'm generating your Initial Integration Partner Profile document...

‚úì Processing target system information
‚úì Organizing documentation resources
‚úì Compiling vendor contact details
‚úì Creating technical questions list
‚úì Generating Integration Partner Profile

Your OpenEMR Integration Partner Profile has been created!

üìÑ Generated: openemr-integration-partner-profile.md
üìã Technical questions prepared for vendor engagement
üîç Ready for Phase 2: Technical Research and API Testing

Next Steps:
1. Review the generated Integration Partner Profile
2. Use the technical questions to engage with OpenEMR community
3. Proceed to Story 3.2 for API testing and technical validation

Would you like me to:
a) Show you the generated Integration Partner Profile
b) Create the vendor technical questions document
c) Move to the technical research phase
```

## Demo Output: Generated Integration Partner Profile

Here's a sample of what would be generated:

   - How should we handle rate limit exceeded scenarios?
   - Are there different limits for different endpoints?

3. **Data Access:**
   - Which FHIR resources are fully implemented?
   - What patient data elements are available through FHIR endpoints?
   - Are there any custom extensions or modifications to standard FHIR?

4. **Security & Compliance:**
   - What security certifications does OpenEMR maintain?
   - How is PHI protected in API communications?
   - What audit logging is available for API access?

## Next Steps - Technical Research Phase

### Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Community Engagement:** Post questions in OpenEMR community forum
2. **Sandbox Testing:** Set up test environment using demo instance
3. **API Exploration:** Test basic authentication and patient data endpoints
4. **Documentation Review:** Deep dive into FHIR implementation details

### Technical Validation Required
1. **Authentication Testing:** Verify OAuth2 flow with sandbox environment
2. **Endpoint Validation:** Test key FHIR endpoints (Patient, Observation, etc.)
3. **Data Model Analysis:** Examine actual API responses for data quirks
4. **Performance Testing:** Assess response times and rate limit behavior

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Open source with active community and documentation
- **Medium Risk:** Need to validate FHIR compliance and data completeness
- **Considerations:** Community support model vs. commercial vendor support

## Integration Readiness Score: 7/10
- ‚úÖ Strong documentation available
- ‚úÖ Active developer community
- ‚úÖ FHIR R4 support confirmed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to validate API completeness
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Support model considerations for production
