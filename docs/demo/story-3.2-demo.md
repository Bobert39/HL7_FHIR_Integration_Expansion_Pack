# Story 3.2 Demo: API Endpoint and Authentication Analysis

## Demo Scenario: OpenEMR API Technical Validation

**Input**: Integration Partner Profile from Story 3.1 (`openemr-integration-partner-profile.md`)
**Goal**: Validate OpenEMR API capabilities, test authentication, and confirm technical requirements

### Step 1: Continue with Integration Analyst from Story 3.1

```bash
# User continues with Healthcare System Integration Analyst
# Agent is already activated from Story 3.1
*technical-research
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Perfect! Now that we have your initial OpenEMR Integration Partner Profile, let's validate the technical capabilities through hands-on API testing.

This phase will confirm authentication methods, test key endpoints, and validate the technical information we gathered in the scoping phase.

**Step 1: Prerequisites Validation**

Let me check that we have everything needed for technical testing:

1. Do you have the Integration Partner Profile from our initial scoping phase?
   ‚úì Found: openemr-integration-partner-profile.md

2. Have you received API credentials from the vendor?
   a) Yes, I have production credentials
   b) Yes, I have sandbox/demo credentials
   c) No, but I can use the public demo environment
   d) No, I need to request credentials

Please select your option:
```

### Step 2: User Provides Credentials Status

```bash
# User responds
c
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Excellent! OpenEMR provides a public demo environment which is perfect for our technical validation.

3. Do you have access to Postman, curl, or another API testing tool?
   a) Yes, I have Postman installed
   b) Yes, I prefer curl/command line
   c) Yes, I have other API testing tools
   d) No, I need guidance on tool setup

Your choice:
```

### Step 3: Tool Setup and Environment Configuration

```bash
# User responds
a
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Perfect! Postman is an excellent choice for API testing and documentation.

4. Based on our Integration Partner Profile, OpenEMR has a demo environment at https://demo.openemr.io/

Let me guide you through the technical validation process:

**Step 2: Authentication Testing Setup**

I'll provide you with a step-by-step Postman setup guide for OpenEMR API testing:

‚úì Generating Postman collection configuration
‚úì Setting up environment variables for OpenEMR demo
‚úì Configuring authentication endpoints
‚úì Preparing test request templates

Here's your OpenEMR API testing workflow:
```

### Step 4: Generated Postman Testing Guide

**Agent provides comprehensive testing instructions:**

```markdown
# OpenEMR API Testing Guide - Postman Configuration

## Environment Setup

### Step 1: Create New Postman Environment
1. **Environment Name:** OpenEMR Demo Testing
2. **Environment Variables:**
   ```
   base_url: https://demo.openemr.io
   fhir_base: {{base_url}}/apis/default/fhir
   auth_endpoint: {{base_url}}/oauth2/default/token
   client_id: [to be provided by demo environment]
   client_secret: [to be provided by demo environment]
   access_token: [will be populated after authentication]
   ```

### Step 2: Authentication Testing

#### Test 1: OAuth2 Token Acquisition
**Request Configuration:**
- **Method:** POST
- **URL:** `{{auth_endpoint}}`
- **Headers:**
  - `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- **Body (form-data):**
  - `grant_type: client_credentials`
  - `client_id: {{client_id}}`
  - `client_secret: {{client_secret}}`
  - `scope: patient/read`

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scope": "patient/read"
}
```

#### Test 2: Token Validation
**Request Configuration:**
- **Method:** GET
- **URL:** `{{fhir_base}}/metadata`
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}`
  - `Accept: application/fhir+json`

**Expected Response:** FHIR CapabilityStatement

### Step 3: Core FHIR Endpoint Testing

#### Test 3: Patient Resource Query
**Request Configuration:**
- **Method:** GET
- **URL:** `{{fhir_base}}/Patient`
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}`
  - `Accept: application/fhir+json`
- **Parameters:**
  - `_count: 5` (limit results for testing)

#### Test 4: Specific Patient Retrieval
**Request Configuration:**
- **Method:** GET
- **URL:** `{{fhir_base}}/Patient/[patient-id]`
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}`
  - `Accept: application/fhir+json`

#### Test 5: Observation Resources
**Request Configuration:**
- **Method:** GET
- **URL:** `{{fhir_base}}/Observation`
- **Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer {{access_token}}`
  - `Accept: application/fhir+json`
- **Parameters:**
  - `patient: [patient-id]`
  - `_count: 10`
```

### Step 5: Interactive Testing Session

**Agent continues with real-time guidance:**
```
Now let's execute these tests step by step:

**Step 3: Authentication Flow Testing**

Please follow these steps in Postman:

1. **Set up the environment** with the variables I provided
2. **Execute the OAuth2 token request** (Test 1)

What happened when you ran the authentication request?
a) ‚úÖ Success - I received an access token
b) ‚ùå Error - Authentication failed
c) ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial - I got a response but it looks different
d) ‚ùì I need help with the setup

Your result:
```

### Step 6: Results Analysis and Documentation

Based on user testing results, the agent analyzes and documents findings:

```bash
# Assuming successful authentication
‚úÖ Success - I received an access token
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Excellent! Authentication is working correctly.

Now let's test the core FHIR endpoints:

3. **Execute the FHIR metadata request** (Test 2) to verify API access
   This will confirm that your token works and show OpenEMR's FHIR capabilities.

4. **Test patient data access** (Test 3) to see actual data structures

Please run these tests and tell me:
- What FHIR version does the CapabilityStatement indicate?
- How many patient records were returned in the Patient query?
- What does a sample patient record look like (structure-wise)?

After you've run these tests, I'll update your Integration Partner Profile with the confirmed technical details.
```

### Step 7: Integration Partner Profile Update

**Agent processes test results and updates the profile:**

```
Fantastic work! Based on your testing results, I'm now updating your OpenEMR Integration Partner Profile with confirmed technical details:

‚úì Authentication method validated: OAuth2 client credentials flow
‚úì API base URL confirmed: https://demo.openemr.io/apis/default/fhir
‚úì FHIR version verified: R4 (4.0.1)
‚úì Core endpoints tested: Patient, Observation, metadata
‚úì Token management documented: 1-hour expiration, Bearer token format
‚úì Rate limiting observed: [based on testing results]

üìÑ Updating: openemr-integration-partner-profile.md
üìä Adding: API test results and performance metrics
üîß Creating: Postman collection export for future use
