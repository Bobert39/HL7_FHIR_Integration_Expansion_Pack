# Story 3.3 Demo: Document Data Model and Identify Quirks

## Demo Scenario: OpenEMR Data Model Analysis and FHIR Mapping

**Input**: Enhanced Integration Partner Profile from Story 3.2 + Sample API responses
**Goal**: Complete comprehensive data analysis and produce final Integration Partner Profile

### Step 1: Continue with Integration Analyst from Story 3.2

```bash
# User continues with Healthcare System Integration Analyst
# Agent is already activated from previous stories
*document-quirks
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Excellent! Now for the final phase of our OpenEMR integration research: comprehensive data model analysis and quirks documentation.

This critical phase will analyze actual API response data to identify FHIR mapping requirements and document any non-standard behaviors that the development team needs to know about.

**Phase 1: Preparation and Context Gathering**

I have your enhanced Integration Partner Profile from our technical testing phase. Now I need to analyze actual data structures.

1. Do you have sample API response payloads from your testing in Story 3.2?
   a) Yes, I have JSON responses from multiple endpoints
   b) Yes, I have some responses but need to get more
   c) No, I need guidance on collecting sample data
   d) I have the responses but in a different format

Your choice:
```

### Step 2: Sample Data Collection

```bash
# User responds
a
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Perfect! Having actual API responses is crucial for accurate analysis.

2. Which types of data samples do you have available?
   Please select all that apply:
   a) Patient demographic data
   b) Clinical observations (lab results, vital signs)
   c) Encounter/visit information
   d) Medication data
   e) Provider/practitioner information
   f) Organization/facility data

Please list your selections (e.g., "a, b, c"):
```

### Step 3: Data Samples Provided

```bash
# User responds with sample data types
a, b, c, d
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Excellent coverage! Patient, observations, encounters, and medications give us a comprehensive view of OpenEMR's data model.

**Phase 2: Data Model Analysis**

I'll guide you through systematic analysis of each data type. For each sample, I'll help you:
- Document the complete data structure
- Identify FHIR resource mappings
- Spot any non-standard implementations
- Note data quality considerations

Let's start with the Patient data. Please provide a sample Patient resource response from OpenEMR (anonymized/de-identified of course).

You can paste the JSON structure here, or tell me the key fields you observed:
```

### Step 4: Sample Patient Data Analysis

**User provides sample (anonymized) OpenEMR Patient JSON:**

```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "95f37ef0-55ba-4c08-bde1-7da5b5b0a354",
  "meta": {
    "versionId": "1",
    "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T14:30:00+00:00"
  },
  "identifier": [
    {
      "use": "usual",
      "type": {
        "coding": [
          {
            "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0203",
            "code": "MR"
          }
        ]
      },
      "value": "12345",
      "assigner": {
        "display": "OpenEMR Demo"
      }
    }
  ],
  "active": true,
  "name": [
    {
      "use": "official",
      "family": "Doe",
      "given": ["John", "Middle"]
    }
  ],
  "telecom": [
    {
      "system": "phone",
      "value": "555-123-4567",
      "use": "home"
    },
    {
      "system": "email",
      "value": "john.doe@example.com"
    }
  ],
  "gender": "male",
  "birthDate": "1985-06-15",
  "address": [
    {
      "use": "home",
      "line": ["123 Main St"],
      "city": "Anytown",
      "state": "CA",
      "postalCode": "12345",
      "country": "US"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Agent Response:**
```
Excellent! This is a well-structured FHIR R4 Patient resource. Let me analyze this:

‚úÖ **FHIR Compliance Analysis:**
- Standard FHIR R4 Patient resource structure
- Proper use of FHIR meta data (versionId, lastUpdated)
- Standard identifier system (v2-0203 MR code)
- Compliant telecom and address structures

‚úÖ **Data Quality Observations:**
- Complete demographic information
- Proper date formatting (ISO 8601)
- Standard use codes for name, telecom, address

‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Integration Considerations:**
- Identifier system uses "MR" (Medical Record) - confirm if this is consistent
- Assigner display uses "OpenEMR Demo" - will be different in production
- Need to verify if patient photos or additional identifiers are available

Now let's look at your Observation sample. This will show us how clinical data is structured...
```

### Step 5: Clinical Data Analysis

**Agent continues with comprehensive analysis of each data type, identifying:**

1. **FHIR Resource Mapping Completeness**
2. **Custom Extensions or Modifications**
3. **Data Quality Patterns**
4. **Non-standard Behaviors**
5. **Integration Challenges**

### Step 6: Quirks and Non-Standard Behaviors Documentation

**Agent identifies and documents specific quirks:**

```
**Phase 3: Quirks and Integration Challenges Identified**

Based on my analysis of your OpenEMR API responses, I've identified several important patterns and quirks:

üìã **Data Quirks Documentation:**

**1. Date/Time Handling Quirks:**
- ‚úÖ Standard: ISO 8601 formatting used consistently
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quirk: Some timestamps show server timezone, others UTC
- üîß Integration Need: Normalize timezone handling in our code

**2. Identifier Management:**
- ‚úÖ Standard: FHIR identifier structure followed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quirk: Some custom identifier types may use local codes
- üîß Integration Need: Validate identifier type mappings

**3. Observation Value Formatting:**
- ‚úÖ Standard: Proper FHIR Quantity structures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quirk: Some lab values have non-standard unit codes
- üîß Integration Need: Unit code translation mapping required

**4. Reference Handling:**
- ‚úÖ Standard: Internal references use resource/id format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quirk: Some references may be contained resources vs references
- üîß Integration Need: Handle both reference styles

**5. Custom Extensions:**
- ‚úÖ Standard: No non-FHIR extensions observed in samples
- ‚úÖ Good: Clean FHIR R4 implementation
- üîß Integration Need: Minimal custom handling required
```

### Step 7: Complete Integration Partner Profile Generation
