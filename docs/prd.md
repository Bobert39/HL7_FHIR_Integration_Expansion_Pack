# Product Requirements Document: HL7 FHIR Integration Expansion Pack

## Section 1 of 8: Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Accelerate Integration:** Reduce the end-to-end time required for a typical healthcare integration project by at least 75%.
- **Increase Adoption:** Achieve 1,000 active users or downloads of the expansion pack within the first year.
- **Improve Developer Efficiency:** Decrease the number of development hours spent on research, discovery, and debugging by 50% for teams using the pack.

### Background Context

This project will create a **BMad Method Expansion Pack** to solve the significant challenges healthcare developers face when integrating AI applications with EHR and Practice Management software. The current process is slow, expensive, and error-prone due to the need for siloed expertise in clinical informatics, FHIR standards, and security. This expansion pack will provide a holistic framework with a team of specialized AI agents to automate best practices and guide developers, transforming a complex, fragmented process into a streamlined workflow.

## Section 3 of 8: Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

The source code for this expansion pack will be managed in a single monorepo. This will simplify dependency management and ensure consistency across all the pack's components (agents, tasks, templates, etc.).

### Service Architecture

The architecture of the expansion pack itself is a **BMad Standard File-Based Architecture**, consisting of Markdown and YAML files. The code generated by the pack for integrations will follow a Serverless or Microservice pattern, a decision to be finalized by the Architect.

### Testing Requirements

The code generated by this pack must adhere to a **Full Testing Pyramid** approach, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The pack itself will be validated via comprehensive checklists and end-to-end workflow execution tests.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Primary Language for Generated Code:** C# / .NET will be the initial target language for all code templates due to its native integration with the Firely SDK.
- **Core Toolchain:** The pack is exclusively designed to orchestrate the Firely toolchain (Forge, Simplifier.net, Firely Terminal).
- **API Standards:** All interactions will be based on the FHIR R4 standard, with support for SMART on FHIR authorization.
