# Section 5 of 8: Epic 1 Foundation & Core Agent Setup

## Epic Goal

This foundational epic establishes the complete file structure and configuration for the BMad Expansion Pack. It involves creating the necessary directories and placeholder files for all agents, workflows, tasks, and templates. The primary value is a fully initialized, version-controlled project that is ready for the functional workflows to be built in subsequent epics.

### Story 1.1: Initialize Project & Define Agents

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the expansion pack project to be initialized with the correct folder structure and have all four agent definition files created,  
so that the core "team" of the pack is established and version controlled.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A new monorepo is created with a root `package.json` file.
- A `.bmad-core` directory is created at the root, containing subdirectories for agents, workflows, tasks, templates, and data.
- Four agent markdown files are created in `.bmad-core/agents/`:  
  - `fhir-interoperability-specialist.md`
  - `clinical-informaticist.md`
  - `security-analyst.md`
  - `integration-analyst.md`
- Each agent file is populated with its name, ID, title, icon, and the detailed persona definition we brainstormed.

### Story 1.2: Define Workflow & Task Placeholders

**As a BMad user,**  
I want placeholder files for all core workflows and their associated tasks to be created,  
so that the high-level process flow of the expansion pack is documented and ready for implementation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Three workflow YAML files are created in `.bmad-core/workflows/`:  
  - `specification-workflow.yaml`
  - `development-workflow.yaml`
  - `deployment-workflow.yaml`
- Each workflow file is populated with its ID, name, and a high-level description.
- Placeholder markdown files for all identified tasks (e.g., `create-fhir-profile.md`, `perform-data-mapping.md`, `configure-access-control.md`) are created in the `.bmad-core/tasks/` directory.
- The newly created tasks are listed as dependencies in their respective agent definition files.

### Story 1.3: Define Template Placeholders

**As a BMad user,**  
I want placeholder files for all core technical and documentation templates,  
so that the reusable artifacts of the expansion pack are cataloged and ready to be built out.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Placeholder YAML or Markdown files for all identified templates (e.g., `fhir-profile.tmpl.yaml`, `implementation-guide.tmpl.md`) are created in the `.bmad-core/templates/` directory.
- The newly created templates are listed as dependencies in their respective agent definition files.
