# Section 7 of 8: Epic 3 Integration Research & Documentation Workflow

## Epic Goal

This epic empowers the Healthcare System Integration Analyst agent to perform its core function: researching and documenting the specific technical details of target EHR/PM systems. It provides the structured process for gathering vendor documentation, testing endpoints, and identifying data quirks. The value delivered is a comprehensive Integration Partner Profile document that de-risks the development phase by providing a clear blueprint of the system we are connecting to.

### Story 3.1: Conduct Initial System Scoping

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the Integration Analyst agent to guide me through the initial discovery of a target system,  
so that I can gather all publicly available documentation and prepare for a technical deep-dive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Integration Analyst agent has an `initial-scoping` task that takes a target system name (e.g., "OpenEMR") as input.
- The task guides the user to find and list the target system's public API documentation URLs and developer contact information.
- The task uses a template to help the user generate a list of key questions for the vendor's technical team (regarding auth, rate limits, security).
- The task's output is a partially completed Integration Partner Profile document containing the initial findings.

### Story 3.2: Perform API Endpoint and Authentication Analysis

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the Integration Analyst agent to guide me in testing a target system's key API endpoints and authentication flow,  
so that I can confirm how to connect to the system and what data it returns.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Integration Analyst agent has a `technical-research` task that uses the Integration Partner Profile as input.
- The task provides guidance on using a tool like Postman to test the system's authentication endpoint and retrieve an access token.
- The task guides the user on how to query a sample patient record from the target API.
- The Integration Partner Profile is updated with the confirmed "API Base URL," "Authentication Method," and a list of "Endpoints and Supported Operations."

### Story 3.3: Document Data Model and Identify Quirks

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the Integration Analyst agent to help me analyze a sample data payload and document the system's data model and unique quirks,  
so that the development team is aware of any non-standard behaviors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Integration Analyst agent has a `document-quirks` task that takes a sample API response (e.g., a JSON payload) as input.
- The task guides the user to identify specific data fields that need to be mapped to FHIR resources.
- The task helps the user document any non-standard behaviors (e.g., custom codes, unusual date formats) in the "Data Quirks" section of the Integration Partner Profile.
- The task produces a completed Integration Partner Profile document as its final output.
