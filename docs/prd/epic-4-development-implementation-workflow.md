# Section 8 of 8: Epic 4 Development & Implementation Workflow

## Epic Goal

This is the core implementation epic where the BMad agents guide the creation of functional integration code. Leveraging the FHIR profiles from Epic 2 and the vendor research from Epic 3, the agents will generate C# code templates and provide step-by-step instructions for implementing the business logic. The primary value is the transformation of specifications into working, testable code that connects to the target EHR system.

### Story 4.1: Generate C# Service Scaffolding

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to generate a basic C#/.NET service project,  
so that I have a clean, organized starting point for my integration code that includes the necessary dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Specialist agent has a `generate-scaffolding` task that takes the Integration Partner Profile as input.
- The task generates a new .NET project with a standard structure (e.g., Controllers, Services, Models).
- The generated project includes the Firely .NET SDK as a dependency.
- A basic API controller with a health-check endpoint (`/health`) is created to verify the project runs correctly.

### Story 4.2: Implement Data Mapping and Transformation Logic

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to guide me in writing the C# code to map data from the target system's format to our FHIR profile,  
so that data can be correctly and reliably transformed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Specialist agent has an `implement-data-mapping` task that uses the Integration Partner Profile and the FHIR StructureDefinition file as input.
- The agent provides C# code templates for a "mapping service" that takes the vendor's data model as input and outputs a valid FHIR resource.
- The agent provides specific guidance on handling the "data quirks" documented in the research phase.
- Unit tests are generated for the mapping service to verify the correct transformation of all required fields.

### Story 4.3: Implement API Endpoint with Live FHIR Validation

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to guide me in creating the final API endpoint that uses the mapping service and validates the output against our profile,  
so that the integration service is complete and guaranteed to be compliant.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Specialist agent has an `implement-api-endpoint` task.
- The task provides C# code for an API endpoint (e.g., `GET /Patient/{id}`) that calls the target vendor's API.
- The endpoint uses the mapping service from the previous story to transform the vendor's data.
- The agent provides guidance on integrating the Firely SDK's validation methods into the endpoint's logic to validate the created FHIR resource against the project's profile before returning it.
- The endpoint successfully returns a valid, compliant FHIR resource or a structured error message if validation fails.
