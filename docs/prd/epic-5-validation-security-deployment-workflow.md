# Epic 5: Validation, Security & Deployment Workflow

## Epic Goal

This final epic focuses on ensuring the integration is robust, secure, and ready for a production environment. It will activate the Security Analyst and Specialist agents to perform critical validation, compliance checks, and risk assessments. The value delivered is a production-ready integration that has been rigorously tested for data integrity, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to HIPAA standards, providing confidence to deploy.

### Story 5.1: Implement Automated FHIR Resource Validation

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to create an automated test suite for validating FHIR resources,  
so that I can continuously ensure the data integrity of my integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Specialist agent has a `create-validation-suite` task.
- The task guides the user to write a test script (e.g., in a .NET test project) that uses Firely Terminal or the Firely SDK's validation methods.
- The script can take a directory of sample FHIR resources as input and validate each one against the project's official profiles.
- The script outputs a clear report of any validation errors.
- The test suite is structured so it can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

### Story 5.2: Conduct Security and Compliance Assessment

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the Healthcare IT Security Analyst agent to guide me through a security and compliance review of the integration service,  
so that I can verify it meets all regulatory requirements before deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Security Analyst agent has a `conduct-security-assessment` task that uses the Security and Compliance Policy template.
- The task provides guidance on reviewing the service's access control settings (e.g., SMART on FHIR scopes).
- The task provides instructions for checking the FHIR server's audit logs to ensure they meet HIPAA requirements.
- The task includes a step to verify that all data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- The output of the task is a completed Security and Compliance Checklist document, confirming the review has been performed.

### Story 5.3: Finalize and Publish the Implementation Guide

**As a BMad user,**  
I want the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to guide me in finalizing and publishing the complete Implementation Guide (IG),  
so that the project is fully documented and available for external partners to use.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The Specialist agent has an `author-implementation-guide` task that uses the Implementation Guide (IG) Template.
- The task guides the user to assemble all project artifacts: the narrative, all FHIR profiles and extensions, and example resources.
- The agent provides instructions for publishing the final, versioned IG to Simplifier.net.
- The final IG is accessible at a stable URL on Simplifier.net.
