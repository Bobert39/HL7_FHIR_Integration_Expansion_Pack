# Section 1 of 8: Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Accelerate Integration:** Reduce the end-to-end time required for a typical healthcare integration project by at least 75%.
- **Increase Adoption:** Achieve 1,000 active users or downloads of the expansion pack within the first year.
- **Improve Developer Efficiency:** Decrease the number of development hours spent on research, discovery, and debugging by 50% for teams using the pack.

## Background Context

This project will create a **BMad Method Expansion Pack** to solve the significant challenges healthcare developers face when integrating AI applications with EHR and Practice Management software. The current process is slow, expensive, and error-prone due to the need for siloed expertise in clinical informatics, FHIR standards, and security. This expansion pack will provide a holistic framework with a team of specialized AI agents to automate best practices and guide developers, transforming a complex, fragmented process into a streamlined workflow.
