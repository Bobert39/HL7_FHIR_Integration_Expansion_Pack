## Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** The pack shall provide four distinct AI agents: FHIR Interoperability Specialist, Clinical Informaticist, Healthcare IT Security Analyst, and Healthcare System Integration Analyst.
- **FR2:** The pack shall provide three core workflows: Specification & Profiling, Development & Implementation, and Testing & Deployment.
- **FR3:** The agents shall be capable of executing their defined tasks, such as creating FHIR profiles, performing data mapping, configuring access control, and researching vendor APIs.
- **FR4:** The pack shall provide a complete suite of templates for technical artifacts (e.g., FHIR Profiles, Extensions) and documentation (e.g., Implementation Guides, Security Policies).
- **FR5:** The agents' workflows shall guide a user through the process of connecting to a target system, defining the data interchange, and validating the final integration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** All artifacts and agent guidance must adhere strictly to the HL7 FHIR R4 standard.

- **NFR3:** All provided templates and agent-generated outputs must be HIPAA-compliant by default.
- **NFR4:** The expansion pack must be installable and operable within a standard BMad-Method environment.
- **NFR5:** The language and guidance used by the agents must be clear and accessible to a developer who is not a FHIR or clinical informatics expert.
- **NFR6:** The expansion pack's structure must be modular to allow for future maintenance and updates (e.g., adding support for FHIR R5).
