# Section 3 of 8: Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

The source code for this expansion pack will be managed in a single monorepo. This will simplify dependency management and ensure consistency across all the pack's components (agents, tasks, templates, etc.).

## Service Architecture

The architecture of the expansion pack itself is a **BMad Standard File-Based Architecture**, consisting of Markdown and YAML files. The code generated by the pack for integrations will follow a Serverless or Microservice pattern, a decision to be finalized by the Architect.

## Testing Requirements

The code generated by this pack must adhere to a **Full Testing Pyramid** approach, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. The pack itself will be validated via comprehensive checklists and end-to-end workflow execution tests.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Primary Language for Generated Code:** C# / .NET will be the initial target language for all code templates due to its native integration with the Firely SDK.
- **Core Toolchain:** The pack is exclusively designed to orchestrate the Firely toolchain (Forge, Simplifier.net, Firely Terminal).
- **API Standards:** All interactions will be based on the FHIR R4 standard, with support for SMART on FHIR authorization.
