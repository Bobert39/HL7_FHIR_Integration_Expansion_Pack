# Story 1.1: Initialize Project & Define Agents

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the expansion pack project to be initialized with the correct folder structure and have all four agent definition files created,
**so that** the core "team" of the pack is established and version controlled.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new monorepo is created with a root `package.json` file.
2. A `.bmad-core` directory is created at the root, containing subdirectories for agents, workflows, tasks, templates, and data.
3. Four agent markdown files are created in `.bmad-core/agents/`:
   - `fhir-interoperability-specialist.md`
   - `clinical-informaticist.md`
   - `security-analyst.md`
   - `integration-analyst.md`
4. Each agent file is populated with its name, ID, title, icon, and the detailed persona definition we brainstormed.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create root project structure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create root `package.json` file with appropriate metadata
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create `.bmad-core` directory structure with subdirectories: agents, workflows, tasks, templates, data
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Verify directory structure aligns with source tree specification

- [x] Task 2: Create and populate agent definition files (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create `fhir-interoperability-specialist.md` with complete agent definition
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create `clinical-informaticist.md` with complete agent definition
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create `healthcare-it-security-analyst.md` with complete agent definition
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Create `healthcare-system-integration-analyst.md` with complete agent definition

- [x] Task 3: Validate structure compliance (AC: All)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Verify all agent files follow AgentConfiguration data model structure
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Ensure file naming conventions match source tree specification
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Validate that monorepo structure supports BMad framework requirements

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the epic.

### Data Models
**AgentConfiguration (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agentconfiguration-md]:
- `id`: string - The unique identifier for the agent (e.g., "clinical-informaticist")
- `name`: string - The human-friendly name of the agent
- `persona`: object - A structured object containing the agent's role, style, and core principles
- `dependencies`: object - Lists of tasks, templates, and workflows the agent is authorized to use

### Project Structure Requirements
**Source Tree Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Root directory: `hl7-fhir-expansion-pack/`
- `.bmad-core/` directory containing:
  - `agents/` - Contains four agent definition files
  - `data/` - For non-executable data or knowledge files (empty for now)
  - `tasks/` - Contains task definition files
  - `templates/` - Contains reusable templates
  - `workflows/` - Contains workflow definition files
- `docs/` - Output directory for generated documents
- Root level files: `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `README.md`

**Specific Agent Filenames** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- `clinical-informaticist.md`
- `fhir-interoperability-specialist.md`
- `healthcare-it-security-analyst.md` (not `security-analyst.md`)
- `healthcare-system-integration-analyst.md` (not `integration-analyst.md`)

### File Locations
**Directory Structure** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```
hl7-fhir-expansion-pack/
├── .bmad-core/
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── tasks/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── workflows/
├── docs/
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Pack Definition Language: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates
- Standard BMad framework compliance required

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Agent definition files must be in Markdown format
- Follow BMad framework conventions for agent definition structure

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Test file organization: All test files must be in separate test project
- File naming: Test files must correspond to class being tested
- No specific testing requirements for this story as it involves file creation, not code implementation

**Story-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Validate that all created files exist in correct locations
- Verify that agent files contain required structural elements
- Confirm directory structure matches specification

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality. All acceptance criteria have been fully met with precise adherence to architectural specifications. The project structure follows BMad framework conventions exactly, and all agent files contain comprehensive persona definitions with proper YAML structure. File naming conventions match the source tree specification requirements perfectly.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The implementation is clean and follows all established standards.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (Markdown/YAML usage as specified - no C# in this story)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Matches docs/architecture/source-tree.md exactly)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (No testing required for file creation tasks)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All 4 acceptance criteria fully satisfied)

### Improvements Checklist

All items completed during development - no additional improvements needed:

- [x] Root package.json created with proper BMad metadata
- [x] .bmad-core directory structure established per specification
- [x] Four specialized healthcare agent files created with correct naming
- [x] Agent files follow BMad framework conventions completely
- [x] File naming matches source tree specification exactly

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. This story involves project initialization and agent definition files only.

### Performance Considerations

No performance concerns for this story. File structure setup has no runtime impact.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during QA review - implementation was already compliant.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-initialize-project-define-agents.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, standards compliant, no issues identified.
