# Story 1.2: Define Workflow & Task Placeholders

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** placeholder files for all core workflows and their associated tasks to be created,
**so that** the high-level process flow of the expansion pack is documented and ready for implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Three workflow YAML files are created in `.bmad-core/workflows/`:
   - `specification-workflow.yaml`
   - `development-workflow.yaml`
   - `research-workflow.yaml`
2. Each workflow file is populated with its ID, name, and a high-level description.
3. Placeholder markdown files for all identified tasks (e.g., `create-fhir-profile.md`, `perform-data-mapping.md`, `configure-access-control.md`) are created in the `.bmad-core/tasks/` directory.
4. The newly created tasks are listed as dependencies in their respective agent definition files.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create workflow definition files (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create `specification-workflow.yaml` following WorkflowDefinition data model
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create `development-workflow.yaml` following WorkflowDefinition data model
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Create `research-workflow.yaml` following WorkflowDefinition data model
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Populate each workflow with ID, name, and description based on core workflows

- [x] Task 2: Create task placeholder files (AC: 3)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create task files for Clinical Informaticist agent tasks
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Create task files for FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent tasks
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Create task files for Security Analyst agent tasks
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Create task files for Integration Analyst agent tasks
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Populate each task file with basic TaskDefinition structure

- [x] Task 3: Update agent dependencies (AC: 4)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Update agent files to reference their respective task dependencies
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Update agent files to reference their respective workflow dependencies
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Validate dependency structure follows AgentConfiguration model

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the basic project structure and agent files. The agent files now exist and need to be updated with task and workflow dependencies.

### Data Models
**WorkflowDefinition (.yaml)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#workflowdefinition-yaml]:
- `id`: string - The unique identifier for the workflow (e.g., "specification-workflow")
- `name`: string - The human-friendly name of the workflow
- `sequence`: array - An ordered list of steps, defining the agents and tasks involved in the process

**TaskDefinition (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#taskdefinition-md]:
- `id`: string - The unique identifier for the task (e.g., "create-fhir-profile")
- `description`: string - A detailed description of the task's objective and method
- `inputs`: object - The required inputs for the task (e.g., a clinical requirements document)
- `outputs`: object - The expected artifacts produced by the task (e.g., a FHIR StructureDefinition file)

**AgentConfiguration (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agentconfiguration-md]:
- `dependencies`: object - Lists of tasks, templates, and workflows the agent is authorized to use

### Core Workflows Analysis
**Workflow 1: Specification & Profiling** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-1-specification-profiling]:
- Involves Clinical Informaticist and FHIR Specialist agents
- Key steps: clinical requirements definition, profile creation, publication, clinical review
- Maps to `specification-workflow.yaml`

**Workflow 2: Integration Research** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2-integration-research]:
- Involves Integration Analyst agent
- Key steps: initial scoping, API testing, documentation
- Maps to `research-workflow.yaml`

**Workflow 3: Development and Validation** [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-3-development-and-validation]:
- Involves FHIR Specialist and Security Analyst agents
- Key steps: project scaffolding, code implementation, validation, security review
- Maps to `development-workflow.yaml`

### Task Identification from Source Tree
**Tasks listed in source tree** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- `conduct-security-assessment.md`
- `create-fhir-profile.md`
- `document-clinical-requirements.md`
- `initial-scoping.md`

### File Locations
**Workflow Files Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```
.bmad-core/workflows/
├── development-workflow.yaml
├── research-workflow.yaml
└── specification-workflow.yaml
```

**Task Files Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```
.bmad-core/tasks/
├── conduct-security-assessment.md
├── create-fhir-profile.md
├── document-clinical-requirements.md
└── initial-scoping.md
```

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Pack Definition Language: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates
- Standard BMad framework compliance required

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- File structure validation required
- Workflow and task files must follow data model specifications
- Agent dependency references must be valid

**Story-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Validate all workflow YAML files are properly formatted
- Verify all task markdown files contain required structural elements
- Confirm agent files correctly reference new task and workflow dependencies
- Ensure file names and locations match source tree specification
