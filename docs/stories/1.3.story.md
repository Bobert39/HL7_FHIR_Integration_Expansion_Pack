# Story 1.3: Define Template Placeholders

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** placeholder files for all core technical and documentation templates,
**so that** the reusable artifacts of the expansion pack are cataloged and ready to be built out.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Placeholder YAML or Markdown files for all identified templates (e.g., `fhir-profile.tmpl.yaml`, `implementation-guide.tmpl.md`) are created in the `.bmad-core/templates/` directory.
2. The newly created templates are listed as dependencies in their respective agent definition files.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create template placeholder files (AC: 1)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create `fhir-profile.tmpl.yaml` following TemplateDefinition data model
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Create `implementation-guide.tmpl.md` following TemplateDefinition data model
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Create `integration-partner-profile.tmpl.md` following TemplateDefinition data model
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Populate each template file with basic TemplateDefinition structure

- [x] Task 2: Update agent dependencies (AC: 2)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Update Clinical Informaticist agent file to reference relevant template dependencies
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Update FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent file to reference relevant template dependencies
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Update Security Analyst agent file to reference relevant template dependencies
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Update Integration Analyst agent file to reference relevant template dependencies
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Validate dependency structure follows AgentConfiguration model

- [x] Task 3: Validate template structure compliance (AC: All)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Verify all template files follow TemplateDefinition data model structure
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Ensure file naming conventions match source tree specification
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Validate that template structure supports BMad framework requirements

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1 and 1.2 established the basic project structure, agent files, workflow files, and task files. The agent files now exist and need to be updated with template dependencies to complete the foundational setup.

### Data Models
**TemplateDefinition (.yaml or .md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#templatedefinition-yaml-or-md]:
- `id`: string - The unique identifier for the template
- `format`: string - The output format (e.g., "markdown", "csharp")
- `structure`: object - The content and placeholder variables for the template

**AgentConfiguration (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agentconfiguration-md]:
- `dependencies`: object - Lists of tasks, templates, and workflows the agent is authorized to use

### Template Analysis from Source Tree
**Templates listed in source tree** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- `fhir-profile.tmpl.yaml` - For FHIR profile generation
- `implementation-guide.tmpl.md` - For documentation generation
- `integration-partner-profile.tmpl.md` - For integration research documentation

### File Locations
**Template Files Location** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
```
.bmad-core/templates/
├── fhir-profile.tmpl.yaml
├── implementation-guide.tmpl.md
└── integration-partner-profile.tmpl.md
```

### Agent-Template Mapping
Based on core workflows and agent responsibilities:

**FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent**:
- `fhir-profile.tmpl.yaml` - Used in profile creation tasks
- `implementation-guide.tmpl.md` - Used for technical documentation

**Clinical Informaticist Agent**:
- `implementation-guide.tmpl.md` - Used for clinical documentation

**Integration Analyst Agent**:
- `integration-partner-profile.tmpl.md` - Used for integration research documentation

**Security Analyst Agent**:
- No specific templates identified in source tree, but may reference implementation guide for security documentation

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Pack Definition Language: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates
- Standard BMad framework compliance required

**Template Formats**:
- YAML templates for structured data (FHIR profiles)
- Markdown templates for documentation artifacts

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- Template files must follow TemplateDefinition data model specifications
- Agent dependency references must be valid

**Story-Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Validate all template files are properly formatted according to their specified format
- Verify all template files contain required TemplateDefinition structural elements
- Confirm agent files correctly reference new template dependencies
- Ensure file names and locations match source tree specification
- Validate template placeholders and structure support their intended use cases

## Dev Agent Record

*This section will be populated by the development agent during implementation*

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (Full Stack Developer Agent - James)

### Debug Log References
No debug issues encountered during implementation

### Completion Notes List
- Created three comprehensive template files with complete TemplateDefinition structures
- FHIR profile template includes interactive elicitation for profile metadata, elements, constraints, and extensions
- Implementation guide template provides comprehensive structure for clinical and technical documentation
- Integration partner profile template covers all aspects of healthcare system integration planning
- All templates include proper validation rules, quality gates, and BMad framework compliance
- Agent dependencies were already properly configured in Story 1.1 and verified for accuracy

### File List
- `/.bmad-core/templates/fhir-profile.tmpl.yaml` (created)
- `/.bmad-core/templates/implementation-guide.tmpl.md` (created)
- `/.bmad-core/templates/integration-partner-profile.tmpl.md` (created)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Outstanding implementation quality. All acceptance criteria have been fully met with comprehensive template definitions that follow TemplateDefinition data model specifications precisely. The template files include sophisticated interactive elicitation capabilities, structured content sections, validation rules, and proper BMad framework compliance. Agent dependency references are correctly configured across all relevant agents.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was required. The implementation demonstrates excellent adherence to BMad framework conventions and template design patterns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (YAML/Markdown template structure follows BMad conventions)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Files correctly placed per source tree specification)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Template structure validation completed)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All 2 acceptance criteria fully satisfied)

### Improvements Checklist

All items completed during development - excellent implementation quality:

- [x] Three comprehensive template files created with complete TemplateDefinition structure
- [x] FHIR profile template includes interactive elicitation and validation rules
- [x] Implementation guide template provides comprehensive documentation structure
- [x] Integration partner profile template covers all integration planning aspects
- [x] Agent dependencies correctly reference appropriate templates
- [x] All templates support interactive workflows with advanced elicitation

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Template definitions include appropriate security considerations sections where relevant.

### Performance Considerations

No performance concerns for this story. Template structure establishment supports efficient generation workflows.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during QA review - implementation exceeded expectations for completeness and quality.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-define-template-placeholders.yml

### Recommended Status
