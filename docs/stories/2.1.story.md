# Story 2.1: Elicit and Document Clinical Requirements

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** to use the Clinical Informaticist agent to perform data mapping and terminology management,
**so that** I can produce a clear requirements document for a new FHIR profile.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Clinical Informaticist agent has a `document-clinical-requirements` task.
2. The task interactively guides the user to map a clinical data element to a FHIR resource and select appropriate medical terminology (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED codes).
3. The task's output is a structured markdown file (`clinical-requirements.md`) that clearly defines the constraints and value sets for the profile.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create Clinical Informaticist agent configuration (AC: 1)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create agent definition file `clinical-informaticist.md` in `.bmad-core/agents/` directory [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

## Dev Notes

### Component Integration Context
This story implements the Clinical Informaticist Agent component which serves as the clinical subject matter expert. [Source: architecture/components.md#component-clinical-informaticist-agent]

**Key Component Responsibilities:**
- Translating healthcare needs and data context into formal technical requirements
- Key interface: `document-clinical-requirements`
- Consumes direct input from the user regarding clinical needs
- Produces `clinical-requirements.md` that feeds into the FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent

### Data Models Required
**AgentConfiguration (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agentconfiguration-md]
- `id`: "clinical-informaticist"
- `name`: Clinical Informaticist Agent
- `persona`: Clinical subject matter expert role, healthcare data translation style
- `dependencies`: Must include `document-clinical-requirements` task

**TaskDefinition (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#taskdefinition-md]
- `id`: "document-clinical-requirements"
- `description`: Interactive guidance for FHIR resource mapping and terminology selection
- `inputs`: User clinical needs and data requirements
- `outputs`: Structured `clinical-requirements.md` file

**TemplateDefinition (.yaml or .md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#templatedefinition-yaml-or-md]
- `id`: "clinical-requirements-template"
- `format`: "markdown"
- `structure`: Constraints, value sets, FHIR resource mappings

### File Locations (BMad Source Tree Structure)
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
```
.bmad-core/
├── agents/
│   └── clinical-informaticist.md          # Agent definition
├── tasks/
│   └── document-clinical-requirements.md  # Task definition
└── templates/
    └── clinical-requirements.tmpl.md      # Output template
```

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Pack Definition Language: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates
- API Standard: HL7 FHIR R4 for data interchange standard
- Core SDK: Firely .NET SDK 5.x for FHIR resource interaction
- Dev Tools: Forge, Simplifier.net, Firely Terminal for profiling and validation

### Workflow Integration
This story is part of Workflow 1: Specification & Profiling [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-1-specification-profiling]
- Produces clinical requirements that feed into Story 2.2 (FHIR profile creation guidance)
- Output (`clinical-requirements.md`) is consumed by FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Test Organization: All test files must be located in a separate test project and follow naming convention (e.g., `DocumentClinicalRequirementsTaskTests.cs`)
- Validation Requirements: All data received from external sources must be validated at the boundary
- Use Custom Exceptions: For business logic or validation failures, throw specific custom exceptions
