# Story 2.2: Guide FHIR Profile Creation in Forge

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to provide a step-by-step guide for creating a profile in Forge,
**so that** I can accurately translate the clinical requirements into a technical FHIR artifact.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent has a `create-profile-in-forge` task that accepts a `clinical-requirements.md` file as input.
2. The agent provides clear, sequential instructions on how to use Forge to constrain a base FHIR resource according to the requirements.
3. The guidance includes instructions on how to use Forge's built-in validation features.
4. The final output of the process is a valid FHIR StructureDefinition file.

## Dev Notes

### Component Integration Context
This story enhances the FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent which handles technical implementation of FHIR standards. [Source: architecture/components.md#component-fhir-interoperability-specialist-agent]

**Key Component Responsibilities:**
- Technical implementation of FHIR standards
- Translates clinical requirements into compliant FHIR artifacts and functional C#/.NET code
- Key interfaces: `generate-scaffolding`, `implement-data-mapping`, `implement-api-endpoint`, `create-validation-suite`, `create-profile-in-forge`
- Dependencies: Consumes `clinical-requirements.md` from Clinical Informaticist agent (Story 2.1 output)
- Produces FHIR StructureDefinition files for further processing

### Previous Story Context
**Story 2.1 Integration:**
- Depends on `clinical-requirements.md` output from Clinical Informaticist agent
- Builds on the data mapping and terminology management from previous story
- Continues the Specification & Profiling workflow sequence

### Data Models Required
**AgentConfiguration (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#agentconfiguration-md]
- `id`: "fhir-interoperability-specialist"
- `name`: FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent
- `persona`: Technical FHIR implementation specialist, translates clinical to technical
- `dependencies`: Must include `create-profile-in-forge` task

**TaskDefinition (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#taskdefinition-md]
- `id`: "create-profile-in-forge"
- `description`: Step-by-step guidance for Forge profile creation with validation
- `inputs`: `clinical-requirements.md` file from Clinical Informaticist
- `outputs`: Valid FHIR StructureDefinition file and Forge workflow documentation

**TemplateDefinition (.yaml or .md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#templatedefinition-yaml-or-md]
- `id`: "forge-workflow-guide"
- `format`: "markdown"
- `structure`: Sequential Forge instructions, validation steps, troubleshooting

    ├── forge-workflow-guide.tmpl.md           # Forge instructions template
    └── structure-definition-validation.tmpl.md # Validation template
```

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Dev Tools**: Forge, Simplifier.net, Firely Terminal for profiling, collaboration, and validation
- **API Standard**: HL7 FHIR R4 for data interchange standard
- **Core SDK**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x for FHIR resource parsing, validation, and interaction
- **Pack Definition Language**: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates

### FHIR Integration Requirements
**Forge Integration:**
- Must provide step-by-step instructions for Forge tool usage
- Include guidance on base FHIR resource selection and constraining
- Cover validation features usage within Forge environment
- Output validation for generated StructureDefinition files

**FHIR R4 Compliance:**
- All generated profiles must be FHIR R4 compliant
- StructureDefinition files must pass Firely validation
- Integration with Firely .NET SDK requirements

### Workflow Integration
This story is part of Workflow 1: Specification & Profiling [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-1-specification-profiling]
- Consumes `clinical-requirements.md` from Story 2.1
- Produces FHIR StructureDefinition for Story 2.3 (publication workflow)
- Bridges clinical requirements to technical FHIR implementation

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Test Organization: All test files must be located in a separate test project and follow naming convention
- Validation Requirements: All data received from external sources (clinical-requirements.md) must be validated at boundary
- Use Custom Exceptions: For business logic or validation failures, throw specific custom exceptions (e.g., `FhirValidationException`)

**FHIR-Specific Testing:**
- Validate StructureDefinition file format compliance
- Test integration with Firely .NET SDK validation
- Verify Forge workflow instruction accuracy
