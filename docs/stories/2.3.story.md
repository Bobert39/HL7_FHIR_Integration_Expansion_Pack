# Story 2.3: Guide Profile Publication and Review

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** agents to guide me through publishing the new profile to Simplifier.net and performing a collaborative review,
**so that** the profile is centrally documented, versioned, and clinically validated.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent has a `publish-to-simplifier` task that guides the user on uploading the StructureDefinition file.
2. The task prompts the user to engage the Clinical Informaticist agent for review once the profile is published.
3. The Clinical Informaticist agent has a `review-simplifier-profile` task that guides the user on how to interpret the human-readable view on Simplifier.net.
4. The review task concludes with a formal approval step, confirming the profile meets the clinical requirements.
