# Story 3.1: Conduct Initial System Scoping

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the Integration Analyst agent to guide me through the initial discovery of a target system,
**so that** I can gather all publicly available documentation and prepare for a technical deep-dive.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Integration Analyst agent has an `initial-scoping` task that takes a target system name (e.g., "OpenEMR") as input.
2. The task guides the user to find and list the target system's public API documentation URLs and developer contact information.
3. The task uses a template to help the user generate a list of key questions for the vendor's technical team (regarding auth, rate limits, security).
4. The task's output is a partially completed Integration Partner Profile document containing the initial findings.

## Dev Notes

### Component Integration Context
This story implements the Healthcare System Integration Analyst Agent which handles research and documentation of target vendor systems. [Source: architecture/components.md#component-healthcare-system-integration-analyst-agent]

**Key Component Responsibilities:**
- Researching and documenting technical specifics of target vendor systems
- Key interfaces: `initial-scoping`, `technical-research`, `document-quirks`
- Dependencies: Consumes user input (target system) and external vendor documentation
- Produces Integration Partner Profile that feeds into FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent

### Epic Integration Context
This story initiates Epic 3: Integration Research & Documentation Workflow which focuses on gathering comprehensive technical details about target EHR/PM systems. [Source: Epic 3 goal statement]

**Epic 3 Value Delivery:**
- De-risks development phase by providing clear blueprint of connection targets
- Produces comprehensive Integration Partner Profile document
- Establishes structured process for vendor documentation and endpoint testing

- `id`: "healthcare-system-integration-analyst"
- `name`: Healthcare System Integration Analyst Agent
- `persona`: Technical system research specialist, vendor documentation expert
- `dependencies`: Must include `initial-scoping` task

**TaskDefinition (.md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#taskdefinition-md]
- `id`: "initial-scoping"
- `description`: Guided discovery of target system documentation and vendor contact information
- `inputs`: Target system name (e.g., "OpenEMR", "Epic", "Cerner")
- `outputs`: Partially completed Integration Partner Profile document with initial findings

**TemplateDefinition (.yaml or .md)** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#templatedefinition-yaml-or-md]
- `id`: "integration-partner-profile" - Comprehensive vendor system documentation
- `id`: "vendor-technical-questions" - Structured questions for vendor technical teams
- `id`: "api-documentation-checklist" - Systematic documentation discovery guide

```

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Pack Definition Language**: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates
- **API Standard**: HL7 FHIR R4 for data interchange standard (target for integration research)
- **Authorization Standard**: SMART on FHIR v2 for secure access analysis
- **Core SDK**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x awareness for future integration compatibility

### Integration Research Requirements
**Target System Analysis:**
- Must support various EHR/PM systems (OpenEMR, Epic, Cerner, AllScripts, etc.)
- Include API documentation discovery and cataloging
- Cover authentication flow analysis and documentation
- Address rate limiting, security, and compliance considerations

**Vendor Communication:**
- Structured approach to vendor technical team engagement
- Key question templates for auth, rate limits, security, and compliance
- Contact information gathering and relationship management
- Documentation of vendor response and follow-up requirements

### Component Interaction Pattern
**Integration Analyst Workflow Position:**
- Initiates Epic 3 research phase independent of Epic 2 outputs
- Produces Integration Partner Profile for consumption by FHIR Interoperability Specialist
- Feeds into Epic 4 Development workflow through comprehensive system documentation
- Supports Epic 5 Security workflow through vendor security assessment

### Workflow Integration
This story initiates Workflow 2: Integration Research [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2-integration-research]
- Begins vendor system discovery and documentation process
- Establishes foundation for subsequent technical research stories (3.2, 3.3)
- Produces Integration Partner Profile that supports development planning

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Test Organization: All test files must be located in a separate test project and follow naming convention
- Validation Requirements: All data received from external sources (target system names, vendor URLs) must be validated at boundary
- Use Custom Exceptions: For business logic or validation failures, throw specific custom exceptions

**Research Workflow Testing:**
- Validate target system name processing and normalization
- Test template generation with various vendor system types
- Verify Integration Partner Profile document structure and completeness
- Mock external vendor documentation discovery workflows
