# Story 3.2: Perform API Endpoint and Authentication Analysis

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the Integration Analyst agent to guide me in testing a target system's key API endpoints and authentication flow,
**so that** I can confirm how to connect to the system and what data it returns.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Integration Analyst agent has a `technical-research` task that uses the Integration Partner Profile as input.
2. The task provides guidance on using a tool like Postman to test the system's authentication endpoint and retrieve an access token.
3. The task guides the user on how to query a sample patient record from the target API.
4. The Integration Partner Profile is updated with the confirmed "API Base URL," "Authentication Method," and a list of "Endpoints and Supported Operations."

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Pack Definition Language**: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates
- **API Standard**: HL7 FHIR R4 for data interchange standard validation
- **Authorization Standard**: SMART on FHIR v2 for secure access validation and testing
- **Core SDK**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x awareness for authentication pattern compatibility
- **Testing Tools**: Postman or equivalent API testing tools for endpoint validation

### API Testing Requirements
**Authentication Flow Testing:**
- Must support various authentication methods (OAuth2, API keys, SMART on FHIR)
- Include token retrieval, validation, and refresh testing
- Cover security parameter validation and error handling
- Document authentication requirements for integration implementation

**Endpoint Analysis:**
- Systematic testing of key FHIR and custom endpoints
- Patient record retrieval validation with sample data
- Response format analysis and documentation
- Error handling and rate limiting behavior validation

**Integration Profile Enhancement:**
- Confirmed API Base URL with testing validation
- Authentication method with working credentials and flow documentation
- Comprehensive endpoint inventory with supported operations
- Performance characteristics and limitation documentation

### Workflow Integration
This story continues Workflow 2: Integration Research [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2-integration-research]
- Consumes Integration Partner Profile from Story 3.1
- Produces technically validated profile for Story 3.3
- Bridges initial discovery to detailed data model analysis
- Provides foundation for development phase planning

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Test Organization: All test files must be located in a separate test project and follow naming convention
- Validation Requirements: All data received from external sources (API responses, credentials) must be validated at boundary
- Use Custom Exceptions: For business logic or validation failures, throw specific custom exceptions

**API Testing Workflow Testing:**
- Mock API endpoint responses for testing guidance validation
- Simulate authentication flows with various provider types
- Validate Integration Partner Profile update mechanisms
- Test error handling for failed authentication and API connectivity

### Security Considerations
**Credential Management:**
- Secure handling of API credentials and tokens during testing
- Documentation of security requirements without exposing sensitive data
- Validation of HTTPS requirements and certificate handling
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention consideration
