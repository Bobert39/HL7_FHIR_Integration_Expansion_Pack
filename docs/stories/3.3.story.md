# Story 3.3: Document Data Model and Identify Quirks

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the Integration Analyst agent to help me analyze a sample data payload and document the system's data model and unique quirks,
**so that** the development team is aware of any non-standard behaviors.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Integration Analyst agent has a `document-quirks` task that takes a sample API response (e.g., a JSON payload) as input.
2. The task guides the user to identify specific data fields that need to be mapped to FHIR resources.
3. The task helps the user document any non-standard behaviors (e.g., custom codes, unusual date formats) in the "Data Quirks" section of the Integration Partner Profile.
4. The task produces a completed Integration Partner Profile document as its final output.

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Pack Definition Language**: Markdown, YAML for defining agents, workflows, tasks, and templates
- **API Standard**: HL7 FHIR R4 for data interchange standard and mapping validation
- **Core SDK**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x awareness for FHIR resource structure validation
- **Authorization Standard**: SMART on FHIR v2 for understanding secure data access patterns
- **Data Formats**: JSON/XML payload analysis capabilities for various vendor response formats

### Data Analysis Requirements
**FHIR Mapping Identification:**
- Must analyze API response fields against FHIR R4 resource structures
- Identify patient demographics, clinical data, and administrative information mapping
- Document field-to-FHIR-element relationships for development team guidance
- Provide mapping confidence levels and transformation requirements

**Non-Standard Behavior Documentation:**
- Custom code systems and value sets that differ from standard terminologies
- Unusual date/time formats and timezone handling patterns
- Data validation rules and constraints specific to the vendor system
- Error response formats and retry/recovery patterns
- Rate limiting behaviors and performance characteristics

**Integration Profile Completion:**
- Comprehensive vendor system documentation from initial discovery through technical validation
- Complete API documentation with tested endpoints and authentication
- Data model analysis with FHIR mapping guidance
- Quirks and non-standard behavior documentation for development risk mitigation

### Component Interaction Pattern
**Epic 3 Workflow Completion:**
- Consumes all Epic 3 workflow outputs (initial discovery, API testing, data analysis)
- Produces Integration Partner Profile for consumption by FHIR Interoperability Specialist (Epic 4)
- Supports Epic 5 Security workflow through vendor security assessment documentation
- Enables development phase with comprehensive system understanding

### Workflow Integration
This story completes Workflow 2: Integration Research [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2-integration-research]
- Consumes enhanced Integration Partner Profile from Story 3.2
- Produces completed Integration Partner Profile as Epic 3 deliverable
- Enables transition to Epic 4: Development & Implementation workflow
- Provides comprehensive foundation for FHIR integration development

### Testing

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Test Organization: All test files must be located in a separate test project and follow naming convention
- Validation Requirements: All data received from external sources (API payloads, vendor data) must be validated at boundary
- Use Custom Exceptions: For business logic or validation failures, throw specific custom exceptions

**Data Analysis Testing:**
- Sample API response payload processing with various vendor formats
- FHIR mapping identification accuracy validation
- Data quirks detection and documentation completeness
- Integration Partner Profile generation and validation
- Multi-format payload support (JSON, XML, proprietary formats)

### Epic Integration and Handoff
**Epic 3 → Epic 4 Transition:**
- Completed Integration Partner Profile serves as input to Epic 4 Development workflow
- FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent consumes profile for development planning
- Data model analysis enables accurate FHIR resource mapping implementation
- Quirks documentation prevents development surprises and reduces rework risk
