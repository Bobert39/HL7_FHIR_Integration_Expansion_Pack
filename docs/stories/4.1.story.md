# Story 4.1: Generate C# Service Scaffolding

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to generate a basic C#/.NET service project,
**so that** I have a clean, organized starting point for my integration code that includes the necessary dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Specialist agent has a `generate-scaffolding` task that takes the Integration Partner Profile as input.
2. The task generates a new .NET project with a standard structure (e.g., Controllers, Services, Models).
3. The generated project includes the Firely .NET SDK as a dependency.
4. A basic API controller with a health-check endpoint (`/health`) is created to verify the project runs correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Define task inputs (Integration Partner Profile)
  - [x] Define task outputs (scaffolded .NET project)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.3 completion: The Healthcare System Integration Analyst agent was successfully enhanced with comprehensive data analysis capabilities. The Integration Partner Profile structure is now complete and includes sections for data model documentation, FHIR mapping guides, and data quirks tracking. [Source: stories/3.3.story.md#dev-agent-record]

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Primary Language**: C# 12 for all generated integration services
- **Runtime**: .NET 8.0 (LTS) for stability and long-term support
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 for web API implementation
- **Core SDK**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x (non-negotiable core dependency)
- **Authorization**: SMART on FHIR v2 for secure clinical data access

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent** is responsible for technical implementation
- **Key Interfaces**: `generate-scaffolding`, `implement-data-mapping`, `implement-api-endpoint`, `create-validation-suite`
- **Dependencies**: Consumes Integration Partner Profile from Integration Analyst

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Generated code follows BMad monorepo structure
- Core components located in `.bmad-core/` directory
- Agent definitions in `.bmad-core/agents/`
- Task definitions in `.bmad-core/tasks/`
- Templates in `.bmad-core/templates/`

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Languages & Runtimes**: C# 12 targeting .NET 8.0 runtime (mandatory)
- **Style & Linting**: Must include `.editorconfig` file for consistent formatting
- **Test Organization**: Separate test project with corresponding test file names
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for variables, _camelCase for private fields
- **Critical Rules**:
  - NO PHI IN LOGS (use Serilog filters)
  - USE RESILIENCY PATTERNS (Polly for external HTTP calls)
  - VALIDATE ALL INPUTS at service boundaries
  - USE CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS for business logic failures
  - ASYNC EVERYWHERE for I/O operations

### File Locations
Based on project structure, the generated scaffolding should create:
- Main project files in project root
- Controllers in `Controllers/` directory
- Services in `Services/` directory
- Models in `Models/` directory
- Test project as separate companion project

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- **Test file location**: Separate test project with corresponding test file names
- **Test standards**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern with descriptive test method names
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use**: xUnit with FluentAssertions for readable test assertions, Moq for dependency injection and external service mocking
- **Specific testing requirements for this story**:
  - Test project must be separate from main project
  - Test file naming: `{ClassName}Tests.cs` format
  - **Test Categories**: Unit tests for business logic, Integration tests for API endpoints
  - **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% code coverage for generated scaffolding components
  - **Health Check Testing**: Verify /health endpoint returns correct status and dependency validation
  - **Configuration Testing**: Validate Firely SDK configuration and dependency injection setup

### Technical Constraints
- Must target .NET 8.0 LTS for long-term support
- Firely .NET SDK 5.x is non-negotiable core dependency
- ASP.NET Core 8.0 required for web API functionality
- Must follow BMad framework conventions for agent/task definitions

### Containerization Requirements
- **Base Image**: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 for runtime
- **Build Image**: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 for compilation
- **Port Configuration**: Standard ports 8080 (HTTP) and 8081 (HTTPS)
- **Health Check Endpoint**: /health for container orchestration
- **Environment Variables**: ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT, FHIR_SERVER_URL
- **Security**: Non-root user execution for production containers
