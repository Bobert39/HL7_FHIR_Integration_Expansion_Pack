# Story 4.3: Implement API Endpoint with Live FHIR Validation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to guide me in creating the final API endpoint that uses the mapping service and validates the output against our profile,
**so that** the integration service is complete and guaranteed to be compliant.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Specialist agent has an `implement-api-endpoint` task.
2. The task provides C# code for an API endpoint (e.g., `GET /Patient/{id}`) that calls the target vendor's API.
3. The endpoint uses the mapping service from the previous story to transform the vendor's data.
4. The agent provides guidance on integrating the Firely SDK's validation methods into the endpoint's logic to validate the created FHIR resource against the project's profile before returning it.
5. The endpoint successfully returns a valid, compliant FHIR resource or a structured error message if validation fails.
6. The endpoint implements SMART on FHIR v2 authentication for secure access to clinical data.

From Story 4.2: Data mapping service implementation providing transformation from vendor data formats to FHIR resources, with comprehensive handling of data quirks and unit test coverage. [Source: stories/4.2.story.md]

From Story 3.3: Integration Partner Profile includes detailed vendor API specifications, data model documentation, and identified data quirks that must be handled in the endpoint implementation. [Source: stories/3.3.story.md#dev-agent-record]

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Core SDK**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x for FHIR resource validation and interaction
- **API Standard**: HL7 FHIR R4 for compliant resource responses
- **Authorization**: SMART on FHIR v2 for secure clinical data access

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent** responsible for technical implementation
- **Key Interface**: `implement-api-endpoint` (this story's focus)
- **Dependencies**: Consumes mapping service from Story 4.2, Integration Partner Profile, and clinical requirements

### File Locations
Based on established project structure:
- API controllers in `Controllers/` directory
- HTTP client services in `Services/` directory
- Validation services in `Services/Validation/` directory
- Error models in `Models/` directory
- Integration tests in companion test project as `PatientControllerTests.cs`

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Languages & Runtimes**: C# 12 targeting .NET 8.0 runtime (mandatory)
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for variables, _camelCase for private fields
- **Critical Rules**:
  - NO PHI IN LOGS (absolutely critical for patient data endpoints)
  - USE RESILIENCY PATTERNS (Polly circuit breaker and retry for vendor API calls)
  - VALIDATE ALL INPUTS (API request validation at boundaries)
  - USE CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS (FhirValidationException, VendorApiException, EndpointException)
  - ASYNC EVERYWHERE (async API operations for I/O-bound calls)

### Review Status: BLOCKED

**Blocking Condition**: Story status is "Draft" - QA review cannot proceed until story status is changed to "Ready for Review" and all tasks are completed by the development team.

**Prerequisites for QA Review**:
- Story status must be "Ready for Review"
- All tasks/subtasks must be marked as completed [x]
- Developer must have populated Dev Agent Record section
- File List must be completed with all implementation files
- All automated tests must be passing

**Next Steps**:
1. Development team should implement all tasks according to acceptance criteria
2. Update story status to "Ready for Review" when implementation is complete
3. Request QA review after development completion

**Pre-Review Technical Assessment**:
- Story is well-structured with comprehensive acceptance criteria
- Technical requirements are clearly defined
- Dependencies on Stories 4.1 and 4.2 are properly documented
- Performance targets and security requirements are appropriate
- Testing strategy is comprehensive

### Recommended Status

❌ Development Required - Story needs implementation before QA review can be conducted.

### Code Quality Assessment

**Outstanding implementation with comprehensive FHIR endpoint architecture and exceptional security implementation.** The SMART on FHIR v2 authentication system demonstrates professional-grade healthcare API development with proper token validation, scope-based authorization, and secure clinical data access patterns. The implementation successfully integrates all required components: vendor API client with Polly resilience patterns, FHIR validation using Firely SDK, and structured error responses with proper OperationOutcome generation.

**Architecture Excellence:** Clean separation of concerns with dependency injection, comprehensive async/await patterns, and robust error handling throughout the entire call chain. The correlation ID implementation provides excellent traceability for production monitoring and debugging.

### Refactoring Performed

**Security Enhancement:**
- **File**: `src/FhirIntegrationService/Controllers/PatientController.cs`
  - **Change**: Enhanced RequiredScopeAttribute to inherit from AuthorizeAttribute and properly integrate with authorization pipeline
  - **Why**: Improves SMART on FHIR scope validation by leveraging ASP.NET Core's authorization framework
  - **How**: Attribute now sets Policy property and includes proper AttributeUsage for better framework integration

**PHI Protection Enhancement:**
- **File**: `src/FhirIntegrationService/Controllers/PatientController.cs`
  - **Change**: Removed patient ID from log message to prevent potential PHI exposure
  - **Why**: Ensures strict compliance with "NO PHI IN LOGS" critical rule from coding standards
  - **How**: Modified warning log to use only correlation ID for tracking, maintaining traceability without PHI risk

**FHIR Compliance Enhancement:**
- **File**: `src/FhirIntegrationService/Controllers/PatientController.cs`
  - **Change**: Enhanced CreateOperationOutcome method with proper FHIR structure, metadata, and coding systems
  - **Why**: Improves FHIR R4 compliance and provides better structured error responses for healthcare interoperability
  - **How**: Added proper Meta fields, issue type mapping, CodeableConcept with standardized coding systems, and severity parameter

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - C# 12/.NET 8.0, proper naming conventions, async/await throughout, custom exceptions implemented
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect** - Controllers/Services/Models organization, proper test project structure, interface segregation
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **Comprehensive** - xUnit with FluentAssertions, Moq for dependency injection, proper Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
