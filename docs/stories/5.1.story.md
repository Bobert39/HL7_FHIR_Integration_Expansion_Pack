# Story 5.1: Implement Automated FHIR Resource Validation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the FHIR Interoperability Specialist agent to create an automated test suite for validating FHIR resources,
**so that** I can continuously ensure the data integrity of my integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Specialist agent has a `create-validation-suite` task.
2. The task guides the user to write a test script (e.g., in a .NET test project) that uses Firely Terminal or the Firely SDK's validation methods.
3. The script can take a directory of sample FHIR resources as input and validate each one against the project's official profiles.
4. The script outputs a clear report of any validation errors.
5. The test suite is structured so it can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.3: Complete API endpoint implementation with FHIR validation using Firely .NET SDK, providing foundation for validation patterns. The FhirValidationService implementation shows established patterns for profile-based validation that should be extended for automated testing. [Source: stories/4.3.story.md#dev-agent-record]

From Epic 4 completion: Integration service is now functionally complete with vendor API integration, data mapping, and live FHIR validation. Story 5.1 focuses on automated testing infrastructure to ensure continuous data integrity validation. [Source: stories/4.3.story.md]

### Technical Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Primary Language**: C# 12 for all validation suite implementation
- **Framework**: .NET 8.0 (LTS) for test project and validation runtime
- **Core SDK**: Firely .NET SDK 5.x for FHIR resource validation and profile compliance
- **Dev Tools**: Firely Terminal integration for validation command-line capabilities
- **API Standard**: HL7 FHIR R4 for resource validation against official profiles

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/components.md]
- **FHIR Interoperability Specialist Agent** responsible for validation suite technical implementation
- **Key Interface**: `create-validation-suite` (this story's primary focus)
- **Dependencies**: Consumes FHIR profiles from previous stories, integration service implementation
- **Validation Context**: Builds upon existing FhirValidationService patterns from Story 4.3

### File Locations
Based on established project structure from Story 4.3:
- Validation test suite in new `src/FhirIntegrationService.ValidationSuite/` project
- Test resources in `tests/resources/` directory for sample FHIR files
- CI/CD scripts in `.github/workflows/` directory
- MSBuild targets in `build/` directory
- Validation reports output to `artifacts/validation/` directory

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Languages & Runtimes**: C# 12 targeting .NET 8.0 runtime (mandatory)
- **Test Organization**: Validation tests in separate test project with descriptive naming
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for variables, _camelCase for private fields
- **Critical Rules**:
  - NO PHI IN LOGS (critical for sample FHIR resources - use synthetic data only)
  - USE RESILIENCY PATTERNS (retry logic for file I/O and network validation calls)
  - VALIDATE ALL INPUTS (validate test resource files and configuration parameters)
  - USE CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS (FhirValidationSuiteException, ResourceLoadException)
  - ASYNC EVERYWHERE (async file operations and validation calls)

### FHIR Validation Technical Requirements
Based on Firely .NET SDK 5.x and previous Story 4.3 implementation:
- **Profile Validation**: Validate against project-specific FHIR profiles created in earlier stories
- **Resource Types**: Support Patient, Observation, and other resources defined in project scope
- **Validation Scope**: Structural validation, terminology validation, and cardinality constraints
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed issue reporting with element paths and validation failure reasons
- **Performance**: Handle batch validation of multiple resources efficiently

### CI/CD Integration Requirements
For automated continuous validation:
- **GitHub Actions**: Integration with existing workflow from project setup
- **Exit Codes**: Proper exit codes for pipeline success/failure determination
- **Artifacts**: Validation reports stored as build artifacts
- **Thresholds**: Configurable validation failure thresholds for pipeline control
- **Notifications**: Integration with build notification systems
- **Workflow Integration Points**:
  - Pre-commit hooks for local validation
  - Pull request validation checks
  - Nightly batch validation runs
  - Release validation gates
- **Pipeline Performance Targets**:
  - Single resource validation: <500ms
  - Batch validation (100 resources): <30 seconds
  - Full test suite execution: <5 minutes
  - Pipeline integration overhead: <2 minutes

### Sample Resource Requirements
For comprehensive validation testing:
- **Synthetic Data**: Use only synthetic, non-PHI FHIR resources for testing
- **Data Generation Tools**:
  - Synthea for realistic patient population generation
  - Firely .NET SDK synthetic data generators for FHIR resource creation
  - FHIR bulk data generation scripts for performance testing
  - Custom edge case generators for boundary condition testing
- **Coverage**: Sample resources covering all supported FHIR resource types
- **Scenarios**: Valid samples, invalid samples, edge cases, and boundary conditions
- **Formats**: Support both JSON and XML FHIR resource formats
- **Versioning**: Aligned with FHIR R4 specification and project profiles
- **Performance Test Data**:
  - Small datasets (10-50 resources) for unit testing
  - Medium datasets (100-500 resources) for integration testing
  - Large datasets (1000+ resources) for performance validation

### Testing
Testing Standards from Architecture for validation suite development:
- **Test file location**: ValidationSuite tests in separate test project
- **Test standards**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern with descriptive validation test method names
- **Testing frameworks and patterns**: xUnit with FluentAssertions for validation result assertions
- **Specific testing requirements for this story**:
  - ValidationSuite.Tests project with comprehensive test coverage
  - FhirResourceValidatorTests.cs for core validation logic testing
  - ValidationReportTests.cs for report generation testing
