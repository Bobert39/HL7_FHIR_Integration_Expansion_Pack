# Story 5.2: Conduct Security and Compliance Assessment

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the Healthcare IT Security Analyst agent to guide me through a security and compliance review of the integration service,
**so that** I can verify it meets all regulatory requirements before deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The Security Analyst agent has a `conduct-security-assessment` task that uses the Security and Compliance Policy template.
2. The task provides guidance on reviewing the service's access control settings (e.g., SMART on FHIR scopes).
3. The task provides instructions for checking the FHIR server's audit logs to ensure they meet HIPAA requirements.
4. The task includes a step to verify that all data in transit is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
5. The output of the task is a completed Security and Compliance Checklist document, confirming the review has been performed.
