# Epic 4.1: Generate C# Service Scaffolding with Firely SDK

**Story ID:** Epic 4.1
**Epic:** Development & Implementation Workflow
**Priority:** High - Critical Path
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## User Story

**As a healthcare integration developer,**
I want a properly structured .NET service project with Firely SDK integration,
So that I have a clean foundation to build FHIR-compliant data transformation services.

---

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration

- **Integrates with:** OpenEMR API (documented in integration partner profile)
- **Technology:** C#/.NET 6+, Firely .NET SDK, ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Follows pattern:** BMad expansion pack modular service architecture
- **Touch points:** ChemistryPanelObservation FHIR profile, OpenEMR patient data API

### Dependencies

**Input Artifacts:**
- `docs/demo/completed-integration-partner-profile-openemr.md` - OpenEMR API documentation
- `docs/demo/ChemistryPanelObservation.json` - FHIR profile for implementation
- `.bmad-core/templates/` - Project templates and patterns

**Prerequisites:**
- .NET 6+ SDK installed
- Visual Studio or VS Code with C# extension
- Basic understanding of FHIR R4 standard

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

1. **Service Structure:** Create standard .NET Web API project with Controllers, Services, Models folders
2. **Firely Integration:** Firely .NET SDK properly installed and configured as dependency
3. **Health Check:** Basic API controller with `/health` endpoint returns service status

### Integration Requirements

4. **Existing workflows continue:** BMad expansion pack agents and tasks remain operational
5. **Template pattern:** Service follows BMad standard file organization principles
6. **Profile integration:** Project references ChemistryPanelObservation StructureDefinition

### Quality Requirements

7. **Testing foundation:** Unit test project included with basic health check test
8. **Documentation:** README with setup instructions and Firely SDK integration notes
9. **Validation:** Service builds and runs successfully with health endpoint accessible

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Project Structure
```
src/FhirIntegrationService/
â”œâ”€â”€ Controllers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HealthController.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (ready for Epic 4.2)
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (ready for Epic 4.2)
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs
â”œâ”€â”€ appsettings.json
â””â”€â”€ FhirIntegrationService.csproj

tests/FhirIntegrationService.Tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ Controllers/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HealthControllerTests.cs
â””â”€â”€ FhirIntegrationService.Tests.csproj
```

### Required NuGet Packages
- `Hl7.Fhir.R4` (Firely .NET SDK)
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App`
- `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` (for API documentation)
- `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` (test project)
- `xUnit` (test framework)

### Health Check Implementation
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class HealthController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        return Ok(new {
            status = "healthy",
            timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow,
            service = "FHIR Integration Service",
            fhirVersion = "R4"
        });
    }
}
```

---

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Standalone service that will consume OpenEMR API and output FHIR resources
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow .NET Web API standard project template with Firely SDK integration
- **Key Constraints:** Must be compatible with Firely SDK version requirements and FHIR R4 standard
- **Configuration:** Include appsettings for OpenEMR API connection (from integration partner profile)

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] .NET Web API project created with standard structure
- [ ] Firely .NET SDK dependency added and configured
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit test project included with passing health check test
- [ ] Service builds without errors and starts successfully
- [ ] README documentation with setup and integration instructions
- [ ] Project follows BMad expansion pack organizational standards
- [ ] Configuration ready for Epic 4.2 data mapping implementation

---

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risk
Firely SDK version compatibility or configuration issues

### Mitigation Strategy
- Use latest stable Firely SDK version with documented .NET 6+ compatibility
- Follow official Firely documentation for initial setup
- Test basic FHIR resource creation in health check

### Rollback Plan
Simple project deletion - no existing system impact since this is new service creation

---

## Success Criteria

**Epic 4.1 is complete when:**

1. âœ… Service runs locally with accessible health check endpoint
2. âœ… Firely SDK successfully loads and basic FHIR operations work
3. âœ… Unit tests pass and build pipeline is green
4. âœ… Documentation enables next developer to continue with Epic 4.2
5. âœ… Project structure supports planned data mapping and API endpoint features

---

## Next Steps

**After Epic 4.1 completion:**
- Hand off to Epic 4.2: Implement Data Mapping Logic
- Use this service as foundation for OpenEMR â†’ FHIR transformation
- Leverage established patterns for rapid Epic 4.2-4.3 development
